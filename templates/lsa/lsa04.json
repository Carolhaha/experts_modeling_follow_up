Peripheral nerve injury is a widespread and disabling condition that can impair the individuals daily life. Studies involving medications that may positively affect peripheral nerve regeneration are rare. The aim of this study was to investigate new treatments after peripheral nerve injury using various neuroprotectants, melatonin, alcar and leptin, in the regenerative process in an experimental rat model. Wistar albino rats were randomly divided into eight groups containing equal number of animals. Intraperitoneal injection of melatonin (50mg/kg, for 21days), leptin (1mg/kg, for 21days) and acetyl-l-carnitine (50mg/kg, for six weeks) was performed postoperatively. Histological and electromyographical assessments of the regenerated nerves were performed 12 weeks after surgery. Stereological analysis was performed to estimate myelinated and unmyelinated axon numbers, surface area, myelin thickness and the myelin thickness/axon diameter ratio for each group. The results showed that only alcar has a beneficial effect on the regeneration of unmyelinated axons. Neither melatonin and leptin nor alcar were observed to have any therapeutic effect on the regeneration of myelinated axons. Alcar therapy has a positive effect on the regeneration of unmyelinated fiber in the sciatic nerve. However, the same effect was not observed in myelinated nerve fibers after intraperitoneal application of melatonin and leptin.",

IntroductionElectrical injury is a prominent problem in low income countries with increased morbidity and mortality rate. Nervous system is one of the most susceptible systems to electrical current because of its low resistance. There were different studies demonstrated electrocution effect on the nervous system, however little was made on the cerebellum. AimThis study was conducted to produce an experimental suggestion concerning injury of the nervous system through evaluating Purkinje cell apoptosis and number in rat cerebellum by fatal and non-fatal electric current using histological and immunohistochemical study. Also to support the diagnosis of electrocution as a probable cause of death and delayed neurological damage as well as disability. Materials & methodsFifty male Wistar rats were divided into five groups (10 rats each); control group: normal rats that were sacrificed without exposure to electric current, groups 13 (non-fatal electrocution groups): rats were exposed to alternating electric current (220v, 50Hz) for one minute then were sacrificed immediately, after 2h, and after 4h respectively, and group 4 (fatal electrocution group): rats were sacrificed after being electrified up to death (15327s). Sections from cerebellum were processed for histological and caspase-3 immunohistochemical study. ResultsPurkinje cells showed marked histopathological changes in the form of shrunken dark stained cells with significant reduction of their number in H &E stained sections when compared to control, widespread argyrophilia, and degenerated organelles along with shrunken irregular nuclei. For caspase-3 staining, there was significantly increased number of caspase-3 positive cells in groups 13 (non-fatal electrocution groups) and markedly increased in group 4 (fatal electrocution group) in comparison to control group. These changes were gradually increased with the increased duration after exposure to the electric current. ConclusionApoptosis and loss of Purkinje cells were involved in the pathogenesis of immediate and long term effect of electrical injury on Purkinje cells, which will be an aid to the forensic pathologist to determine the cause of death and residual damage as well as disability after electric shock.",

Methods and resultsMale Wistar rats (10 weeks old) were treated with 40mg/kg concentration of berberine 1h after focal cerebral ischemia and the anti-inflammatory properties of berberine were evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis, water content measure and behavioral tests. Evaluation of infarct volume was performed by TTC staining. Immunohistochemistry and behavioral assessment indicated recovery in treatment group compared to only ischemia group. The infarct volume decreased in treatment group compared to ischemia group. Berberine administration significantly decreased brain edema and contributed to the restoration of motor function. Moreover, berberine potently contributed to neuroprotection in motor area through downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and upregulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines.

        "des": "The role of CBP following injury is examined.CBP is upregulated following injury in reactive glial cells.Glial CBP is sexually dimorphic following injury.Glial CBP may play a role in injury response. Under neurodegenerative conditions, reactive astrocytes upregulate both aromatase (estrogen synthase) as well as estrogen and androgen receptors. This increased steroidogenic signal promotes neuroprotection and repair by promoting neurogenesis and decreasing cell death, but also by modulating the release of inflammatory molecules. Thus, endocrine  immune cross-talk is an essential component of estrogen mediated neuroprotection following brain injury. However, the exact mechanisms underlying this cross-talk remains unknown. cAMP response element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP) may be involved in the modulation of both the endocrine and inflammatory response following injury. CBP acts as both an estrogen receptor (ER) coactivator and as a promotor for NF-B (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) target genes and previous data suggests that ER and NF-B compete for CBP. When CBP is displaced, target genes for NF-B are repressed and inflammation is decreased. To test the role of CBP following injury, we examined CBP expression following penetrating injury in adult male and female zebra finches. Using immunohistochemistry, we were able to specifically examine glial CBP expression, as glial cells are important mediators of the neuroendocrine response to damage. Male but not female zebra finches upregulated glial CBP following damage to the brain. To determine if this upregulation was estrogen dependent, we decreased local estrogen levels with fadrozole (aromatase inhibitor) and reexamined glial CBP expression following injury. Aromatase inhibition resulted in no change in overall glial CBP expression suggesting that circulating estrogens do not mediate the upregulation of glial CBP following injury. Thus CBP may play a role in the both the estrogen and immune response to injury.",

Neurology, especially aphasiology, was mainly built on behavioral-structural correlations (lesion method). In this setting, Broca's area has been considered as the speech area; moreover, this observation led to localizationism. However, advances in brain mapping techniques, as functional neuroimaging and direct electrical stimulation in patients undergoing awake surgery for gliomas, has resulted in a paradigmatic shift regarding models of neural architecture. In fact, the brain is organized in distributed complex networks underpinning sensorimotor, visuospatial, language, cognitive and emotional functions. In this connectomal workframe, cerebral processing is not conceived as the sum of segregated subfunctions, but results from the integration and potentiation of parallel (even if partially overlapped) subcircuits. Such a networking model, taking into account cortical and subcortical anatomic constraints, explains interindividual variability in physiology and after brain damage, particularly in aphasiology  e.g. double dissociations during electrostimulations, as comprehension versus naming disorders, semantic versus phonemic paraphasias, or syntactic disturbances versus anomia. This dynamic organization mediated by the well-synchronized functioning of delocalized groups of interconnected neurons (rather than by discrete centers) also explains the huge potential of neuroplasticity following cerebral insult, on the condition that the axonal connectivity is preserved. According to this principle, massive surgical resection of brain regions dogmatically considered as critical in a localisationist view can be achieved with no functional deficit, as the removal of Broca's area  which is not the speech area  without disorders. This connectomal account of neural processing may have major implications in cognitive neurosciences and in therapeutic management of brain-damaged patients.",

We previously reported that perineuronal astrocytic and microglial reactions are drastically upregulated in the facial nucleus after facial axotomy at the brain stem surface or the stylomastoid foramen. Furthermore, periaxonal astrocytic and microglial reactions develop retrogradely in the central facial tract which contains proximal facial axons in the brain stem. Because reconnection of interrupted peripheral nerve by microsurgical suture is a common clinical practice, the aim of this study was to investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of glial reactions in the central facial tract and the facial nucleus after facial neurorrhaphy. Here, we show immunofluorescent and immunohistochemical evidence that facial neurorrhaphy at the stylomastoid foramen largely prevented axotomy-induced astrocytic and microglial activation in the central facial tract. In contrast, glial reactions in the facial nucleus were still highly elevated after facial neurorrhaphy. Microglial and astrocytic processes were observed to ensheath the facial motoneurons in the facial nucleus. Nevertheless, the transformation of ramified to amoeboid shape of microglia, occurring at 10 weeks after facial axotomy, was not seen after neurorrhaphy. We further examined the effect of N-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), on glial reactions after neurorrhaphy. Western blot analyses demonstrate that inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) production significantly reduced microglial but not astrocytic reaction in the facial nucleus after neurorrhaphy. Taken together, these results indicate that in contrast to the intense glial reactions in both the central facial tract and the facial nucleus after facial axotomy, glial reactions are differentially regulated in these two compartments after facial neurorrhaphy.

BackgroundThe neonatal development stage of the cerebellum in rats is equivalent to a human foetus in the third trimester of pregnancy. In this stage, cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, and synaptogenesis occur. Clinical and experimental findings have shown that ethanol exposure during brain development causes a variety of disruptions to the brain, including neurogenesis depression, delayed neuronal migration, changes in neurotransmitter synthesis, and neuronal depletion.During postnatal cerebellar development, neurons are more vulnerable to the destructive effects of ethanol. The effects of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) on the number of cells and thickness of the cell layers within the cerebellar cortex were examined during the first two postnatal weeks in rats following postnatal ethanol exposure. MethodPostpartum rats were distributed randomly into six groups. Normal saline was injected intraperitoneally into control animals and ethanol (20%) was injected into the intervention groups for three consecutive days. Intervention groups received LIPUS at different frequencies (3 or 5MHz), after administration of ethanol. After transcardial perfusion, the rats brain was removed, and a complete series of sagittal cerebellum sections were obtained by systematic random manner. Photomicrographs were made with Motic digital cameras and analysed using Nikon digital software. ResultsThe numbers of granular cells decreased in ethanol-treated rats compared to the control group. LIPUS, administered at (3 or 5MHz), combined with ethanol administration resulted in a reduction of ethanol's effects. Using 5MHz LIPUS resulted in significantly higher numbers of granular cells in the internal layer compared to the control rats. Using 3 or 5MHz LIPUS alone resulted in a significant enhancement in the granular cells of the molecular layer. A significant reduction was seen in the thickness of the external granular layer in ethanol-treated rats. ConclusionThis study showed that exposure to LIPUS can affect the number of granular cells and thickness of the cell layer within the cerebellar cortex in neonatal rats. LIPUS also could attenuate ethanol toxicity effects on the cerebellum.",

The Arabian oryx, Oryx leucoryx, is a member of the superorder Cetartiodactyla and is native to the Arabian Desert. The desert environment can be considered extreme in which to sleep, as the ranges of temperatures experienced are beyond what most mammals encounter. The current study describes the nuclear organization and neuronal morphology of the systems that have been implicated in sleep control in other mammals for the Arabian oryx. The nuclei delineated include those revealed immunohistochemically as belonging to the cholinergic, catecholaminergic, serotonergic and orexinergic systems within the basal forebrain, hypothalamus, midbrain and pons. In addition, we examined the GABAergic neurons and their terminal networks surrounding or within these nuclei. The majority of the neuronal systems examined followed the typical mammalian organizational plan, but some differences were observed: (1) the neuronal morphology of the cholinergic laterodorsal tegmental (LDT) and pedunculopontine tegmental (PPT) nuclei, as well as the parvocellular subdivision of the orexinergic main cluster, exhibited Cetartiodactyl-specific features; (2) the dorsal division of the catecholaminergic anterior hypothalamic group (A15d), which has not been reported in any member of the Artiodactyla studied to date, was present in the brain of the Arabian oryx; and (3) the catecholaminergic tuberal cell group (A12) was notably more expansive than previously seen in any other mammal. The A12 nucleus has been associated functionally to osmoregulation in other mammals, and thus its expansion could potentially be a species specific feature of the Arabian oryx given their native desert environment and the need for extreme water conservation.",

Adult pattern was observed finally at 37weeks of gestation.This study concluded that morphological and functional maturation of the human cochlear nuclei occurs simultaneously during mid-gestation which represents the critical period of development and continues up to term. Auditory impulses perceived by the hair cells of the organ of corti are relayed in the cochlear nucleus, the first relay station in the brainstem, by the cochlear nerve. The human foetus is well known to respond to sound during the last trimester of gestation. On the contrary, studies conducted in rat, cat and mouse have shown that these mammals have an immature auditory system at the time of birth. There are very few reports available regarding the morphological and functional maturation of the cochlear nucleus in human. Although the human cochlear nucleus neurons attain adult morphological characters by mid-gestation, there are hardly any studies discussing the functional maturation of the cochlear nucleus. Hence the present study was aimed at observing the morphological as well as functional maturation of the human foetal cochlear nuclei at various gestational ages. Morphological maturation was observed qualitatively while stereological estimation of the volume of well defined ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN) was calculated by the Cavalieri principle; neuronal count and density was estimated by dissector principle. The functional maturation was assessed by observing the expression of synaptophysin, a synaptic marker, at different gestational ages and by the presence of parvalbumin, a calcium binding functional neuronal marker by immunohistochemistry. Neurons showed coarse Nissl's substance and well developed cell processes and gradual increase in cell size by the 24th30th gestational week. Synaptophysin labeling in the complete cochlear nucleus was observed at 20 weeks of gestation. Adult pattern of synaptophysin labeling was observed finally at37weeks of gestation. Earliest presence of parvalbumin expression was detected at 16 weeks of gestation and a distinct adult pattern was seen at 37 weeks of gestation.

The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is a complex integrative centre in the forebrain, composed of multiple sub-nuclei, each with discrete populations of neurons. Progress in understanding BNST function, both in the adult and during postnatal maturation, is dependent upon a more complete characterization of neuronal phenotypes in the BNST. The aim of the current study was to define the molecular phenotype of one postnatal BNST neuronal population, in order to identify molecular factors that may underlie both (protein marker-related) immaturity, and secondly, the transience of this phenotype. This BNST population was originally identified by high, but transient expression of the EGR1 transcription factor (TF) in postnatal rat lateral intermediate BNST (BNSTLI). The current results confirm a high level of Egr1 activation in postnatal day 10 (PN10) male BNSTLI that is lost at PN40, and now demonstrate a similar pattern of transient activation in female brains. Apparent cellular immaturity in this population, as indicated by low levels of the adult neuronal marker NeuN/RBFOX3, was found to be uncorrelated with both key neuronal regulator protein expression (SOX2 and REST), and also RBFOX2 protein levels. The BNSTLI neurons have a partial catecholaminergic phenotype (tyrosine hydroxylase-positive/dopa decarboxylase-negative; TH+ve/DDCve) that is lost at PN40. In contrast, the co-expressed neuropeptide, somatostatin, is maintained, albeit at lower levels, at PN40. The transcriptional basis of the transient and partial catecholaminergic phenotype was investigated by analysing TFs known to maintain adult dopaminergic (TH+ve/DDC+ve) neuronal phenotypes. The BNSTLI neurons were shown to lack forkhead TFs including FOXA1, FOXA2 and FOXO1. In addition, the BNSTLI neurons had low, primarily cytoplasmic, expression of NR4A2/NURR1, an orphan nuclear receptor that is critical for adult maintenance of midbrain dopamine neurons. These results detail the molecular features of an immature neuronal phenotype, and reveal TF deficiencies that may underlie postnatal transience of the phenotype.",

Cytoplasmic mislocalisation and aggregation of TDP-43 and FUS/TLS proteins in spinal motor neurons contribute to the pathogenesis of the highly fatal disorder amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We investigated the neuroprotective effect of VEGF on expression of these proteins in the motor neuronal cell line NSC-34 modelled to reminisce sporadic form of ALS. We studied the expression of TDP-43 and FUS/TLS proteins after exposure to ALS-CSF and following VEGF supplementation by quantitative confocal microscopy and electron microscopy. ALS-CSF caused cytoplasmic overexpression of both the proteins and stress-granule formation in the cells. These alterations were alleviated by VEGF supplementation. The related ultrastructural changes like nuclear membrane dysmorphism and p-bodies associated changes were also reversed. However the protein expression did not completely translocate to the nucleus, as some cells continued to show to cytoplasmic mislocalisation. Thus, the present findings indicate that VEGF alleviates TDP43 and FUS pathology by complimenting its role in controlling apoptosis and reversing choline acetyl transferase expression.

The nuclear organization of the cholinergic, catecholaminergic, serotonergic and orexinergic neurons in the brains of two species of carnivore, the banded mongoose (Mungos mungo) and domestic ferret (Mustela putorius furo), is presented. The banded mongoose belongs to the feliform suborder and the domestic ferret to the caniform suborder, having last shared a common ancestor approximately 53 million years ago; however, they have a very similar overall morphology and life history, presenting an interesting opportunity to examine the extent of evolutionary plasticity in these systems. The brains of the two carnivore species were coronally sectioned and immunohistochemically stained with antibodies against choline acetyltransferase, tyrosine hydroxylase, serotonin and orexin-A. The overall organization and complement of the nuclei of these systems was identical between the two species, although minor differences were noted. Moreover, this overall organization is identical to other studies undertaken in the domestic cat and dog. While for the most part the nuclei forming these systems are similar to those observed in other mammals, two species differences, which appear to be carnivore-specific, were noted. First, cholinergic neurons were observed in the lateral septal nucleus of both species, an apparently carnivore specific feature not recorded previously in other mammals. Second, the serotonergic neurons of the peripheral division of the dorsal raphe complex exhibited a significant caudad expansion, intermingling with the cholinergic and catecholaminergic nuclei of the pons, a carnivore specific feature.

Twenty four Swiss albino mice were divided into three groups; Control, PQ and PQ+Mp. PQ doses were given intraperitoneally, twice in a week and oral dose of ethanolic extract of Mp seed was given for 9 weeks. Nitrite content and lipid peroxidation was measured in all treated groups along with respective controls. RNA was isolated from the nigrostriatal tissue of control and the treated mice and was reverse transcribed into cDNA. PCR was performed to amplify iNOS mRNA and western blot analysis was performed to check its protein level. We had also perfused the mice in all treated group and performed Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and iNOS immunoreactivity in substantia nigra region of mice brain.PQ-treatment increased nitrite content, expression of iNOS and lipid peroxidation compared to respective controls. Mp treatment resulted in a significant attenuation of iNOS expression, nitrite content and lipid peroxidation demonstrating that it reduces nitric oxide in PQ-induced Parkinsons disease. Interestingly; we also observed that mRNA, protein expression and immunoreactivity of iNOS was significantly decreased after Mp treatment and TH immunoreactivity was significantly improved after the treatment of Mp.

BackgroundChordoma are malignant tumors of the axial skeleton, which arise from remnants of the notochord. The Notochord (chorda dorsalis) is an essential embryonic structure involved in the development of the nervous system and axial skeleton. Therefore, the notochord seems to be the most biologically relevant control tissue to study chordoma in molecular biology research. Nevertheless, up to now mainly different tissues but not the notochord have been used as control for chordoma, due to difficulty of isolating notochordal tissue. Here, we describe a fast and precise method of isolating notochordal cells. MethodsExamination of human fetuses, with a gestation of 9, 11 and 13 weeks, using (immuno)histochemical methods was performed. To isolate pure notochord cells for further molecular biology investigation five flash frozen fetuses between 9 and 10 weeks of gestation were dissected by microtome slicing. Thereafter pure notochord cells for further molecular biology investigation where harvested by using laser capture microdissection (LCM). RNA was extracted from these samples and used in quantitative PCR. ResultsThis study illustrates notochord of embryonic spines in three different stages of gestation (91113 weeks). Immunohistochemical staining with brachyury showed strong staining of the notochord, but also weak staining of the intervertebral disc and vertebral body. LCM of notochord slices and subsequent total RNA extraction resulted in a good yield of total RNA. qPCR analysis of two housekeeping genes confirmed the quality of the RNA. ConclusionLCM is a fast and precise method to isolate notochord and the quality and yield RNA extracted from this tissue is sufficient for qPCR analysis. Therefore early embryo notochord isolated by LCM is suggested to be the gold standard for future research in chordoma development, classification and diagnosis.",

In our previous study we showed that Launaea acanthodes extract could effectively stimulate GABA release from PC12 cell culture. The critical role of astrocytes in epileptic brain in regulation of neurotransmitter balance in central nervous system encouraged us to investigate the effect of Launaea acanthodes extract on GABA and glutamate release from astrocytes. Our results indicated that LA extract could stimulates both glutamate uptake and GABA release by astrocytes. The results confirmed this fact that GABA release by astrocytes in response to LA treatment is a glutamate uptake-dependent process. We showed that stimulation of GABA release by Launaea acanthodes is a gene expression based process which depends on glutamate uptake. We propose that glutamate uptake via glutamate transporter 3 could activate expression of glutamate decarboxylase which in turn transforms uptaken glutamate into GABA.",

Intracellular aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau in neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) is a major neuropathological hallmark of taupathies such as Alzheimers disease. Okadaic acid (OKA) is a potent inhibitor of PP2A, leading to abnormal tau phosphorylation. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a neurotrophin that is selectively downregulated in AD. In this study, we investigated the effects of OKA induced tau hyperphosphorylation on secreted and cellular levels of BDNF in primary cortical neurons that were treated with 25nM OKA. Tau phosphorylation at threonine 231 (Thr231) sites was assessed by Western blot using antibodies against phospho-Thr231. Non-phosphorylated tau protein was detected with the Tau-1 antibody. Levels of BDNF secreted to the culture medium were determined by ELISA at the 8th and 24th hours of treatment. Cellular localization and protein expression of BDNF and tau were assessed by immunofluorescent labeling and fluorescent intensity measurements at 24h of treatment. Tau hyperphosphorylation was confirmed with increase in Thr231 and the decrease in Tau-1 signals after 8h of OKA treatment, compared with the control groups, secreted BDNF levels in the OKA-treated group were significantly lower after 24h of treatment but were not significantly different at 8h of treatment. BDNF immunoreactivity was seen in cytoplasm and neurites of the neurons in control group. BDNF immunoreactivity significantly decreased in the OKA treated group and this attenuation was significant especially at neurites.

The results were evaluated using Real-time PCR, Flowcytometry and Immunocytochemistry for two weeks. Our data showed that the cells changed into bipolar morphology and could express markers related to motor neuron; including Hb-9, Pax-6, Islet-1, NF-H, ChAT at the level of mRNA and protein. We could also quantitatively evaluate the expression of Islet-1, ChAT and NF-H at 7 and 14days post- induction using flowcytometry. It is concluded that human UCB-MSCs is potent to express motor neuron- related markers in the presence of RA, Shh and BDNF through a three- step protocol; thus it could be a suitable cell candidate for regeneration of motor neurons in spinal cord injuries.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the distribution and colocalization of cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript peptide (CART) and three calcium-binding proteins (calbindin, calretinin and parvalbumin) in the superficial layers of the superior colliculus (SCs) in the guinea pig. The CART immunoreactivity was observed exclusively in the solitary fibers and neuropil, which formed various CART-ir tiers, that corresponded partially or entirely to anatomically defined layers of the SCs. The CART-ir structures exhibited a characteristic morphology with bundles of densely intermingled neuronal fibers and terminals. This pattern of CART immunoreactivity in the visually driven SCs strongly indicates that CART peptide as a putative neurotransmitter may play an important role in processing of visual information. Double-labeling immunofluorescence showed that CART did not colocalize with either calcium binding proteins (CaBPs). Immunolabeling for CaBPs revealed the presence of different neuronal populations, which were concentrated in variously pronounced tiers.

Methylglyoxal induced stress was inhibited by treatment with URM-II-81. Also, Ser473 and Ser9 phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3 respectively were restored by URM-II-81. Effect of URM-II-81 on axonal integrity was studied by differentiating Neuro2A using retinoic acid. URM-II-81 restored axonal length in MGO treated cells. Its effects were also studied in high fat and low dose streptozotocin induced diabetic mice where it reduced RBG levels and inhibited glycative stress by reducing HbA1c. URM-II-81 treatment also showed inhibition of gliosis in hippocampus.

The neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) plays a key role in several biological processes including reward, mood, motor activity and attention. Synaptic DA homeostasis is controlled by the dopamine transporter (DAT) which transports extracellular DA into the presynaptic neuron after release and regulates its availability to receptors. Many neurological disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, Parkinson disease and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder are associated with imbalances in DA homeostasis that may be related to DAT dysfunction. DAT is also a target of psychostimulant and therapeutic drugs that inhibit DA reuptake and lead to elevated dopaminergic neurotransmission. We have recently demonstrated the acute and chronic modulation of DA reuptake activity and DAT stability through S-palmitoylation, the linkage of a 16-carbon palmitate group to cysteine via a thioester bond. This review summarizes the properties and regulation of DAT palmitoylation and describes how it serves to affect various transporter functions.

Diclofenac sodium (DS) is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug with antipyretic and analgesic effects. It is mainly found in the form of sodium salt. The mechanism of action of DS operates by way of cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition. The physiological effect of this substance derives from a decrease in prostaglandin production. DS is a benzeneacetic acid derivative with anti-inflammatory properties. As a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), DS binds to both forms of COX (COX-1 and COX-2) and inhibits the conversion of arachidonic acid into pro-inflammatory prostaglandins by means of chelation. At the same time, this agent is also able to inhibit tumor angiogenesis, in which COX-2 is involved. DS is effective in overcoming pain and inflammation when it inhibits COX-2, but gastrointestinal side effects appear when it inhibits COX-1.

Animals underwent behavioral evaluations for motor behavior, level of allodynia and hyperalgesia every week. At the end, spinal cord was extracted and IL-6 level was assessed by ELISA method. ResultsTreatment with MPSS and 2-week LLLT had led to motor function recovery (df: 24, 145; F=223.5; p <0.001). SCI did not affect mechanical (df: 24, 145; F=0.5; p=0.09), and cold allodynia (df: 24, 145; F=0.3; p=0.17) but significantly increased mechanical (df: 24, 145; F=21.4; p<0.001) and heat hyperalgesia (df: 24, 145; F=16.1; p<0.001). Treatment with MPSS and 1 and 2-weeks LLLT improved mechanical hyperalgesia (p<0.05) and heat hyperalgesia (p<0.01). The increased level of IL-6 following SCI was also compensated by administration of MPSS or LLLT (df: 4, 10; F=8.74; p=0.003). ConclusionFindings show that long periods of LLLT have better effects in improving the complication of SCI.

The periaqueductal gray (PAG) is a mesencephalic brain structure involved in the expression of numerous behaviours such as maternal, sexual and emotional. Histological approaches showed the PAG is composed by subdivisions with specific cell organisation, neurochemical composition and connections with the rest of the brain. The comparison of studies performed in rodents and cats as the most often examined species, suggests that PAG organisation differs between mammals. However, we should also consider the plurality of the methods used in these studies that makes difficult the comparison of the PAG organisation between species. Therefore, to study the PAG in all mammals including human, the most relevant in vivo imaging method seems to be the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The purpose of this review was to summarize the knowledge of the anatomical organisation of the PAG in mammals and highlights the benefits of MRI methods to extend this knowledge. Results obtained by MRI so far support the conclusions of ex vivo studies, especially to describe the subdivisions and the connections of the PAG. In these latter, diffusion-weighted MRI and functional connectivity seem the most appropriate methods. In conclusion firstly, the MRI seems to be the best judicious method to compare species and improve the comprehension of the role of the PAG. Secondly, MRI is an in vivo method aimed to manage repeated measures in the same cohort of subjects allowing to study the impact of aging and the development on the anatomical organisation of the PAG.",

The effects of devices emitting electromagnetic field (EMF) on human health have become the subject of intense research among scientists due to the rapid increase in their use. Children and adolescents are particularly attracted to the use of devices emitting EMF, such as mobile phones. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate changes in the spinal cords of male rat pups exposed to the effect of 900MHz EMF. The study began with 24 Sprague-Dawley male rats aged 3 weeks. Three groups containing equal numbers of rats were establishedcontrol group (CG), sham group (SG) and EMF group (EMFG). EMFG rats were placed inside an EMF cage every day between postnatal days (PD) 21 and 46 and exposed to the effect of 900MHz EMF for 1h. SG rats were kept in the EMF cage for 1h without being exposed to the effect of EMF. At the end of the study, the spinal cords in the upper thoracic region of all rats were removed. Tissues were collected for biochemistry, light microscopy (LM) and transmission electron microscopic (TEM) examination. Biochemistry results revealed significantly increased malondialdehyde and glutathione levels in EMFG compared to CG and SG, while SG and EMFG catalase and superoxide dismutase levels were significantly higher than those in CG. In EMFG, LM revealed atrophy in the spinal cord, vacuolization, myelin thickening and irregularities in the perikarya. TEM revealed marked loss of myelin sheath integrity and invagination into the axon and broad vacuoles in axoplasm.

Cell phones, an indispensable element of daily life, are today used at almost addictive levels by adolescents. Adolescents are therefore becoming increasingly exposed to the effect of the electromagnetic field (EMF) emitted by cell phones. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of exposure to a 900-MHz EMF throughout adolescence on the lumbar spinal cord using histopathological, immunohistochemical and biochemical techniques. Twenty-four Sprague Dawley (28.343.9g) aged 21days were included in the study. These were divided equally into three groups  control (CG), sham (SG) and electromagnetic (ELMAG). No procedure was performed on the CG rats until the end of the study. SG and ELMAG rats were kept inside an EMF cage (EMFC) for 1h a day every day at the same time between postnatal days 22 and 60. During this time, ELMAG rats were exposed to the effect of a 900-MHz EMF, while the SG rats were kept in the EMFC without being exposed to EMF. At the end of the study, the lumbar regions of the spinal cords of all rats in all groups were extracted. Half of each extracted tissue was stored at 80C for biochemical analysis, while the other half was used for histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses. In terms of histopathology, a lumbar spinal cord with normal morphology was observed in the other groups, while morphological irregularity in gray matter, increased vacuolization and infiltration of white matter into gray matter were pronounced in the ELMAG rats. The cytoplasm of some neurons in the gray matter was shrunken and stained dark, and vacuoles were observed in the cytoplasms. The apoptotic index of glia cells and neurons were significantly higher in ELMAG compared to the other groups. Biochemical analysis revealed a significantly increased MDA value in ELMAG compared to CG, while SOD and GSH levels decreased significantly. In conclusion, our study results suggest that continuous exposure to a 900-MHz EMF for 1h a day through all stages of adolescence can result in impairments at both morphological and biochemical levels in the lumbar region spinal cords of Sprague Dawley rats.",

Olfactory marker protein (OMP) may act as a modulator within the olfactory signal-transduction cascade. It has also been shown to have some importance in development of olfactory sensory organs. Here we used high resolution immunocytochemistry to localize OMP in the rat vomeronasal organ (VNO). Immunofluorescence for OMP was abundant in cilia and in apical dendrites of sensory cells, mostly associated with intraepithelial capillaries. Perikarya were stained to a lesser extent while intense OMP immunoreactivity was seen in axons of sensory neurons. Single cells within the non-sensory portion of the VNO exhibited intense OMP immunofluorescence in apical cilia and weak cytoplasmic staining. Some of the exocrine cells in the vomeronasal glands contained OMP positive secretory granules.

The goals of this study were to use multiple informative markers to define and characterize the neurochemically distinct compartments of the pigeon basal ganglia, especially striatum and accumbens. To this end, we used antibodies against 12 different neuropeptides, calcium-binding proteins or neurotransmitter-related enzymes that are enriched in the basal ganglia. Our results clarify boundaries between previously described basal ganglia subdivisions in birds, and reveal considerable novel heterogeneity within these previously described subdivisions. Sixteen regions were identified that each displayed a unique neurochemical organization. Four compartments were identified within the dorsal striatal region. The neurochemical characteristics support previous comparisons to part of the central extended amygdala, somatomotor striatum, and associational striatum of mammals, respectively. The medialmost part of the medial striatum, however, has several unique features, including prominent pallidal-like woolly fibers and thus may be a region unique to birds. Four neurochemically distinct regions were identified within the pigeon ventral striatum: the accumbens, paratubercular striatum, ventrocaudal striatum, and the ventral area of the lateral part of the medial striatum that is located adjacent to these regions. The pigeon accumbens is neurochemically similar to the mammalian rostral accumbens. The pigeon paratubercular and ventrocaudal striatal regions are similar to the mammalian accumbens shell. The ventral portions of the medial and lateral parts of the medial striatum, which are located adjacent to accumbens shell-like areas, have neurochemical characteristics as well as previously reported limbic connections that are comparable to the accumbens core. Comparisons to neurochemically identified compartments in reptiles, mammals, and amphibians indicate that, although most of the basic compartments of the basal ganglia were highly conserved during tetrapod evolution, uniquely avian compartments may exist as well.",

Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH)-containing neurons are localized in the lateral hypothalamus and incerto-hypothalamic areas, and project to several brain regions including the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). The MCHergic system has been involved in the regulation of emotional states and we have demonstrated that MCH microinjections into the rat DRN promote a depressive-like state. To understand the MCHergic transmission into the DRN, in the present study we characterized the distribution and density of the MCHergic fibers along the rostro-caudal axis of the rat DRN and their anatomical relationship with the 5-HT- and GABA-containing neurons. Additionally, a functional in vivo microdialysis study was carried out in order to evaluate the MCH effects on the 5-HT extracellular levels.Immunolabeling studies showed that MCHergic fibers were widely distributed throughout the rostro-caudal DRN extent and a reduced density at the most caudal level was observed. Interestingly, MCHergic fibers appeared in close apposition to 5-HT and GABA-containing neurons. Microdialysis studies evidenced an opposite effect of two concentrations of MCH on 5-HT levels: the lower concentration (30M) produced a significant and long-lasting (up to 120min) decrease while the higher (100M) induced a slight and brief (20min) increase.Morphological and functional results strongly suggest that both 5-HT- and GABA-containing neurons of the DRN are modulated by MCH. A different sensitivity of these neurons to MCH may explain the dose-response effect on 5-HT release. The decrease in extracellular 5-HT levels may account for the depressive-like effect induced by MCH reported in our previous studies.",

These receptors may be the muscarinic M1 receptor reserve or internalised receptors being degraded. The muscarinic M1 receptor plays a significant role in cognition, probably by modulating information processing in key regions such as the hippocampus. To understand how the muscarinic M1 receptor achieves these functions in the hippocampus, it is critical to know the distribution of the receptor within this complex brain region. To date, there are limited data on the distribution of muscarinic M1 receptors in the human hippocampus which may also be confounded because some anti-muscarinic receptor antibodies have been shown to lack specificity.Initially, using Western blotting and immunohistochemistry, we showed the anti-muscarinic M1 receptor antibody to be used in our study bound to a single 62kDa protein that was absent in mice lacking the muscarinic M1 receptor gene. Then, using immunohistochemistry, we determined the distribution of muscarinic M1 receptors in human hippocampus from 10 subjects with no discernible history of a neurological or psychiatric disorder.Our data shows the muscarinic M1 receptor to be predominantly on pyramidal cells in the hippocampus. Muscarinic M1 receptor positive cells were most apparent in the deep polymorphic layer of the dentate gyrus, the pyramidal cell layer of cornu ammonis region 3, the cellular layers of the subiculum, layer II of the presubiculum and layer III and V of the parahippocampal gyrus. Positive cells were less numerous and less intensely stained in the pyramidal layer of cornu ammonis region 2 and were sparse in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus as well as cornu ammonis region 1. Although immunoreactivity was present in the granular layer of the dentate gyrus, it was difficult to identity individual immunopositive cells, possibly due to the density of cells.This distribution of the muscarinic M1 receptors in human hippocampus, and its localisation on glutamatergic cells, would suggest the receptor has a significant role in modulating excitatory hippocampal neurotransmission.",

Four different current intensities with a constant pulse width of 200s and a constant frequency of 10Hz were used, for intracortical stimulation with an intensity of 0A (sham-stimulation), 10A, 20A and 40A, and for epicortical stimulation 0A, 400A, 600A and 800A. Subsequently all animals underwent c-Fos immunostaining and c-Fos expression was assessed in layer IVI of the primary visual cortex within 200m and 400m distance to the stimulation site. C-Fos expression was higher after intracortical stimulation compared to epicortical stimulation, even though ten times lower current intensities were applied. Furthermore intracortical stimulation resulted in more focal neuronal activation than epicortical stimulation. C-Fos expression was highest after intracortical stimulation with 20A compared to all other intensities. Epicortical stimulation showed a linear increase of c-Fos expression with the highest expression at 800A. Sham stimulation showed similar expression of c-Fos in both hemispheres. The contralateral hemisphere was not affected by intracortical or epicortical stimulation of either intensities. In summary, intracortical stimulation resulted in more focal neuronal activation with less current than epicortical stimulation.

Contact with chemical substances, drugs or environmental agents such as electromagnetic field (EMF) during adolescence therefore has the potential to disturb the development of the morphological architecture of components of the CNS (such as the hippocampus). The hippocampus is essential to such diverse functions as memory acquisition and integration and spatial maneuvering. EMF can result in severe damage to both the morphology of the hippocampus and its principal functions during adolescence. Although children and adolescents undergo greater exposure to EMF than adults, the information currently available regarding the effects of exposure to EMF during this period is as yet insufficient. This study investigated the 60-day-old male rat hippocampus following exposure to 900 megahertz (MHz) EMF throughout the adolescent period using stereological, histopathological and biochemical analysis techniques. Eighteen male Sprague Dawley rats aged 21days were assigned into control, sham and EMF groups on a random basis. No procedure was performed on the control group rats. The EMF group (EMFGr) was exposed to a 900-MHz EMF for 1h daily from beginning to end of adolescence. The sham group rats were held in the EMF cage but were not exposed to EMF. All rats were sacrificed at 60days of age. Their brains were extracted and halved. The left hemispheres were set aside for biochemical analyses and the right hemispheres were subjected to stereological and histopathological evaluation. Histopathological examination revealed increased numbers of pyknotic neurons with black or dark blue cytoplasm on EMFGr slides stained with cresyl violet. Stereological analyses revealed fewer pyramidal neurons in EMFGr than in the other two groups. Biochemical analyses showed an increase in malondialdehyde and glutathione levels, but a decrease in catalase levels in EMFGr.

The granule cells (GCs) and their axons, the mossy fibers (MFs), make synapses with interneurons in the hilus and CA3 area of the hippocampus and with pyramidal cells of CA3, each with distinct anatomical and functional characteristics. Many features of synaptic communication observed at the MF synapses are not usually observed in most cortical synapses, and thus have drawn the attention of many groups studying different aspects of the transmission of information. One particular aspect of the GCs, that makes their study unique, is that they express a dual glutamatergicGABAergic phenotype and several groups have contributed to the understanding of how two neurotransmitters of opposing actions can act on a single target when simultaneously released. Indeed, the GCs somata and their mossy fibers express in a regulated manner glutamate and GABA, GAD, VGlut and VGAT, all markers of both phenotypes. Finally, their activation provokes both glutamate-R-mediated and GABA-R-mediated synaptic responses in the postsynaptic cell targets and even in the MFs themselves. The developmental and activity-dependent expression of these phenotypes seems to follow a logical way to maintain an excitation-inhibition balance of the dentate gyrus-to-CA3 communication.",

Over recent decades, our understanding of the plasticity of the central nervous system has expanded enormously. Accordingly, it is now widely accepted that the brain can adapt to changes by reorganizing its circuitry, both in response to external stimuli and experience, as well as through intrinsic mechanisms. A clear example of this is the activation of a deprived sensory area and the expansion of spared sensory cortical regions in individuals who suffered peripheral sensory loss. Despite the efforts to understand these neuroplastic changes, the mechanisms underlying such adaptive remodeling remains poorly understood. Progress in understanding these events may be hindered by the highly varied data obtained from the distinct experimental paradigms analyzed, which include different animal models and neuronal systems, as well as studies into the onset of sensory loss. Here, we will establish the current stateof-theart describing the principal observations made according to the time of sensory deprivation with respect to the development of the thalamocortical connectivity. We will review the experimental data obtained from animal models where sensory deprivation has been induced either before or after thalamocortical axons reach and invade their target cortical areas. The anatomical and functional effects of sensory loss on the primary sensory areas of the cortex will be presented. Indeed, we consider that the comparative approach of this review is a necessary step in order to help deciphering the processes that underlie sensory neuroplasticity, for which studies in animal models have been indispensable. Understanding these mechanisms will then help to develop restorative strategies and prostheses that will overcome the functional loss.",

AimThis article aimed to assess the efficacy of Schwann cell transplantation on motor function recovery in animal model of spinal cord injuries via meta-analysis. MethodsAn extended search was carried out in the electronic databases of Medline (via PubMed), EMBASE (via OvidSP), CENTRAL, SCOPUS, Web of Science (BIOSIS), and ProQuest. Finally, 41 eligible studies conducted on 1046 animals including 517 control animals and 529 transplanted animals were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) and odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were reported. ResultsThe findings showed that treatment with Schwann cells leads to a modest motor function recovery after spinal cord injury (SMD=0.85; 95% CI: 0.631.07; p<0.001). Transplantation of these cells in acute phase of the injury (immediately after the injury) (OR=4.30; 95% CI: 1.5312.05; p=0.007), application of mesenchymal/skin-derived precursors (OR=2.34; 95% CI: 1.284.29; p=0.008), and cells with human sources are associated with an increase in efficacy of Schwann cells (OR=10.96; 95% CI: 1.4980.77; p=0.02). Finally, it seems that the efficacy of Schwann cells in mice is significantly lower than rats (OR=0.03; 95% CI: 0.0030.41; p=0.009).

ObjectiveThe study evaluated changes in open field behaviours, cerebral cortical histomorphology and biochemical markers of oxidative stress following repeated administration of aspartame in mice. MethodologyAdult mice were assigned into five groups of twelve each. Vehicle (distilled water), or aspartame (20, 40, 80 and 160mg/kg body weight) were administered orally for 28days. Horizontal locomotion, rearing and grooming were assessed after the first and last dose of aspartame. Sections of the cerebral cortex were processed and stained for general histology, and also examined for neuritic plaques using the Bielschwoskys protocol. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neuron specific enolase (NSE) immunoreactivity were assessed using appropriate antibodies. Aspartate and antioxidant levels were also assayed from cerebral cortex homogenates. Data obtained were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. ResultsBody weight and food consumption decreased significantly with aspartame consumption. Locomotion, rearing and grooming increased significantly after first dose, and with repeated administration of aspartame. Histological changes consistent with neuronal damage were seen at 40, 80 and 160mg/kg. Neuritic plaque formation was not evident; while GFAP-reactive astrocytes and NSE-reactive neurons increased at 40 and 80mg/kg but decreased at 160mg/kg. Superoxide dismutase and nitric oxide increased with increasing doses of aspartame, while aspartate levels showed no significant difference. ConclusionThe study showed morphological alterations consistent with neuronal injury and biochemical changes of oxidative stress. These data therefore supports the need for caution in the indiscriminate use of aspartame as a non-nutritive sweetener.",

Morphogenetic proteins are responsible for patterning the embryonic nervous system by enabling cell proliferation that will populate all the neural structures and by specifying neural progenitors that imprint different identities in differentiating neurons. The adoption of specific neurotransmitter phenotypes is crucial for the progression of neuronal differentiation, enabling neurons to connect with each other and with target tissues. Preliminary neurotransmitter specification originates from morphogen-driven neural progenitor specification through the combinatorial expression of transcription factors according to morphogen concentration gradients, which progressively restrict the identity that born neurons adopt. However, neurotransmitter phenotype is not immutable, instead trophic factors released from target tissues and environmental stimuli change expression of neurotransmitter-synthesizing enzymes and specific vesicular transporters modifying neuronal neurotransmitter identity. Here we review studies identifying the mechanisms of catecholaminergic, GABAergic, glutamatergic, cholinergic and serotonergic early specification and of the plasticity of these neurotransmitter phenotypes during development and in the adult nervous system.

BackgroundComponent analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is frequently required to probe the causes and pathologic mechanisms of disease and effective drugs in experimental studies of the central nervous system. Rat and mouse are two kinds of most frequently used animals in experimental studies. Rats are considered to be the most suitable animal for experimental analysis of CSF both on cost and manipulability as mice are too small for drawing CSF. However, drawing CSF from rats is still not easy, which makes many researchers choose bigger animals, such as rabbits. This paper introduced a highly applicable technique of CSF collection from cerebellomedullary cistern (CC) in rats. MethodsCSF collection with this technique was performed by direct CC puncture using a collection apparatus with negative pressure. The apparatus consists of a 1ml syringe, a disposable intravenous infusion needle and a clip. The needle was cut and made less sharp than the original one to avoid injury to the brain and spinal cord. ResultsWe have collected CSF multiple times from each rat with this approach and the collection lasted less than 30s each time on average. The length of the collection needles of the CSF was conformed to the different body sizes (weight) of the rats in the 3 groups. Compared with currently existing methods, this is faster, safer, simpler and repeatable. ConclusionsCSF collection by CC puncture using a negative pressure collection apparatus is fast to operate, safe to the rats, and maximum amount of CSF can be collected.",

Vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2, SLC18A2) is a transmembrane transporter protein that packages dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, and histamine into vesicles in preparation for neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic neuron. VMAT2 function and related vesicle dynamics have been linked to susceptibility to oxidative stress, exogenous toxicants, and Parkinsons disease. To address a recent depletion of commonly used antibodies to VMAT2, we generated and characterized a novel rabbit polyclonal antibody generated against a 19 amino acid epitope corresponding to an antigenic sequence within the C-terminal tail of mouse VMAT2. We used genetic models of altered VMAT2 expression to demonstrate that the antibody specifically recognizes VMAT2 and localizes to synaptic vesicles. Furthermore, immunohistochemical labeling using this VMAT2 antibody produces immunoreactivity that is consistent with expected VMAT2 regional distribution. We show the distribution of VMAT2 in monoaminergic brain regions of mouse brain, notably the midbrain, striatum, olfactory tubercle, dopaminergic paraventricular nuclei, tuberomammillary nucleus, raphe nucleus, and locus coeruleus.

In the setting of rising rates of obesity and metabolic syndrome, characterized in part by hyperinsulinemia, it is increasingly important to understand the mechanisms that contribute to insulin dysregulation. The higher risk for metabolic syndrome imparted by antipsychotic medication use highlights one such mechanism. Though there is great variation in the number and types of signaling pathways targeted by these medications, the one common mechanism of action is through dopamine. Dopamines effects on insulin signaling begin at the level of insulin secretion from the pancreas and continue through the central nervous system.

The pathology of Parkinsons disease (PD) is characterised by the loss of neurons in the substantia nigra parcompacta (A9), which results in the insufficient release of dopamine, and the appearance of motor symptoms. Not all neurons in the A9 subregions degenerate in PD, and the dopaminergic (DA) neurons located in the neighboring ventral tegmental area (A10) are relatively resistant to PD pathogenesis. An increasing number of quantitative studies using human tissue samples of these brain regions have revealed important biological differences. In this review, we first describe current knowledge on the multi-segmental neuromere origin of these DA neurons. We then compare the continued transcription factor and protein expression profile and morphological differences distinguishing subregions within the A9 substantia nigra, and between A9 and A10 DA neurons. We conclude that the expression of three types of factors and proteins contributes to the diversity observed in these DA neurons and potentially to their differential vulnerability to PD. In particular, the specific axonal structure of A9 neurons and the way A9 neurons maintain their DA usage makes them easily exposed to energy deficits, calcium overload and oxidative stress, all contributing to their decreased survival in PD.

It seems that age-dependent changes in stress response may be correlated with alterations in the hypothalamic brain derived neurotrophin factor (BDNF).

Therefore, the aim of our study was to explore the influence of acute and chronic high-light open field (HL-OF) or forced swim (FS) stimulation on the density of BDNF immunoreactive (ir) neurons in the PVN and SON in adult (postnatal day 90; P90) and aged (P720) Wistar Han rats. Our data demonstrated that in comparison with non-stressed rats, neither acute nor chronic FS caused significant changes in the density of BDNF-ir neurons of PVN and SON in P90 or P720 rats. However, a significant increase in the density of BDNF-ir neurons in the SON of P90 and a decrease in the PVN of the P720 rats were noted after acute HL-OF. Despite the lack of change in the density of BDNF-ir neurons between P90 and P720 non-stressed and FS stressed rats, there was an age-dependent decrease in the BDNF-ir cells of HL-OF stressed rats, especially in the PVN. We may conclude that in terms of its influence on the BDNF-ir neurons in PVN and SON, acute HL-OF was the factor inducing changes in the density of BDNF-ir neurons in the hypothalamic nuclei of adult or aged rats.

Similarly loss of dopamine levels were greater in the striatum of LRRK2 G2019S mice when compared to the LRRK2 WT mice when both were treated with MPTP.

Yet, an increasing share of the public expresses concern on this issue. Therefore, this study intends to respond to the growing public concern. The purpose of this study is to reveal whether long term exposure of 2.4GHz frequency RF radiation will cause DNA damage of different tissues such as brain, kidney, liver, and skin tissue and testicular tissues of rats. The study was conducted on 16 adult male WistarAlbino rats. The rats in the experimental group (n=8) were exposed to 2.4GHz frequency radiation for over a year. The rats in the sham control group (n=8) were subjected to the same experimental conditions except the Wi-Fi generator was turned off. After the exposure period was complete the possible DNA damage on the rats brain, liver, kidney, skin, and testicular tissues was detected through the single cell gel electrophoresis assay (comet) method. The amount of DNA damage was measured as percentage tail DNA value. Based on the DNA damage results determined by the single cell gel electrophoresis (Comet) method, it was found that the% tail DNA values of the brain, kidney, liver, and skin tissues of the rats in the experimental group increased more than those in the control group. The increase of the DNA damage in all tissues was not significant (p>0.05). However the increase of the DNA damage in rat testes tissue was significant (p<0.01).In conclusion, long-term exposure to 2.4GHz RF radiation (Wi-Fi) does not cause DNA damage of the organs investigated in this study except testes.

Amphetamines (AMPH) are psychostimulants widely used for therapy as well as for recreational purposes. Previous results of our group showed that AMPH exposure in pregnant rats induces physiological and behavioral changes in the offspring at prepubertal and postpubertal ages.

However, it is still unclear if there are changes to behavioral and morphological levels when low doses of AMPH are administered at a juvenile age. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of AMPH administration (1mg/kg) in Sprague-Dawley rats (postnatal day, PD21-PD35) on locomotor activity in a novel environment and compare the neuronal morphology of limbic system areas at three different ages: prepubertal (PD 36), pubertal (PD50) and postpubertal (PD 62). We found that AMPH altered locomotor activity in the prepubertal group, but did not have an effect on the other two age groups. The Golgi-Cox staining method was used to describe the neural morphology of five limbic regions: (Layers 3 and 5) the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), the dorsal and ventral hippocampus, the nucleus accumbens and the amygdala, showing that AMPH induced changes at pubertal ages in arborization and spine density of these neurons, but interestingly these changes did not persist at postpubertal ages.

Focus on the purinergic receptor P2Y11 has increased following the finding of an association between the sleep disorder narcolepsy and a genetic variant in P2RY11 causing decreased gene expression. Narcolepsy is believed to arise from an autoimmune destruction of the hypothalamic neurons that produce the neuropeptide hypocretin/orexin. It is unknown how a decrease in expression of P2Y11 might contribute to an autoimmune reaction towards the hypocretin neurons and the development of narcolepsy. To advance narcolepsy research it is therefore extremely important to determine the neuroanatomical localization of P2Y11 in the brain with particular emphasis on the hypocretin neurons. In this article we used western blot, staining of blood smears, and flow cytometry to select two antibodies for immunohistochemical staining of macaque monkey brain. Staining was seen in neuron-like structures in cortical and hypothalamic regions. Rats do not have a gene orthologue to the P2Y11 receptor and therefore rat brain was used as negative control tissue. The chromogenic signal observed in macaque monkey brain in neurons was not considered reliable, because the antibodies stained rat brain in a similar distribution pattern. Hence, the neuroanatomical localization of the P2Y11 receptor remains undetermined due to the lack of specific P2Y11 antibodies for brain immunohistochemistry.",

Nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase3 (NTPDase3) is membrane-bound ecto-enzyme which hydrolyzes extracellular ATP, thus modulating the function of purinergic receptors and the pattern of purinergic signaling. Here we analyzed the developmental expression of NTPDase3 in female hypothalamus, cerebral cortex and hippocampal formation at different postnatal ages (PD7-PD90) by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. In hypothalamus and hippocampus, a similar developmental profile was seen: NTPDase3 gene expression was stable during postnatal development and increased in adults. In the cortex, upregulation of NTPDase3 mRNA expression was seen at PD15 and further increase was evidenced in adults. Immunohistochemical analysis at PD7 revealed faint neuronal NTPDase3 localization in a dorsal hypothalamus. The immunoreactivity (ir) gradually increased in PD15 and PD20, in clusters of cells in the lateral, ventral and dorsomedial hypothalamus. Furthermore, in PD20 animals, NTPDase3-ir was detected on short fibers in the posterior hypothalamic area, while in PD30 the fibers appeared progressively longer and markedly varicose. In adults, the strongest NTPDase3-ir was observed in collections of cells in dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus, dorsal and lateral hypothalamus and in several thalamic areas, whereas the varicose fibers traversed entire diencephalon, particularly paraventricular thalamic nucleus, ventromedial and dorsomedial hypothalamic nuclei, the arcuate nucleus and the prefornical part of the lateral hypothalamus.

We thus examined in detail the derivatives of the postulated longitudinal ventral pallium (VPall) sector, which has been defined among other features by its selective ventricular zone expression of Dbx1 (the recent ascription by Puelles, 2014 of the whole olfactory cortex primordium to the VPall was tested). Earlier notions about a gradiental caudorostral reduction of Dbx1 signal were corroborated, so that virtually no signal was found at the olfactory bulb and the anterior olfactory area. The piriform cortex was increasingly labeled caudalwards. The only endopiriform grisea labeled were the ventral endopiriform nucleus and the bed nucleus of the external capsule. Anterior and basolateral parts of the whole pallial amygdala also were densely marked, in contrast to the negative posterior parts of these pallial amygdalar nuclei (leaving apart medial amygdalar parts ascribed to subpallial or extratelencephalic sources of Dbx1-derived GABAergic and non-GABAergic neurons). Alternative tentative interpretations are discussed to explain the partial labeling obtained of both olfactory and amygdaloid structures. This includes the hypothesis of an as yet undefined part of the pallium, potentially responsible for the posterior amygdala, or the hypothesis that the VPall may not be wholly characterized by Dbx1 expression (this gene not being necessary for VPall molecular distinctness and histogenetic potency), which would leave a dorsal Dbx1-negative VPall subdomain of variable size that might contribute partially to olfactory and posterior amygdalar structures.",

The experience of early life stress can trigger complex neurochemical cascades that influence emotional and addictive behaviors later in life in both adolescents and adults. Recent evidence suggests that excessive alcohol drinking and drug-seeking behavior, in general, are co-morbid with depressive-like behavior. Both behaviors are reported in humans exposed to early life adversity, and are prominent features recapitulated in animal models of early life stress (ELS) exposure. Currently, little is known about whether or how ELS modulates reward system nuclei. In this study we use operant conditioning of rats to show that the maternal separation stress (MS) model of ELS consumes up to 3-fold greater quantities of 10% vol/vol EtOH in 1-h, consistently over a 3-week period. This was correlated with a significant 22% reduction in the number of dopaminergic-like neurons in the VTA of naive MS rats, similar to genetically alcohol-preferring (P) rats which show a 35% reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive dopaminergic neurons in the VTA. MS rats had a significantly higher 2-fold immobility time in the forced swim test (FST) and reduced sucrose drinking compared to controls, indicative of depressive-like symptomology and anhedonia. Consistent with this finding, stereological analysis revealed that amygdala neurons were 25% greater in number at P70 following MS exposure. Our previous examination of the dentate gyrus of hippocampus, a region involved in encoding emotional memory, revealed fewer dentate gyrus neurons after MS, but we now report this reduction in neurons occurs without effect on the number of astrocytes or length of astrocytic fibers. These data indicate that MS animals exhibit neuroanatomical changes in reward centers similar to those reported for high alcohol drinking rats, but aspects of astrocyte morphometry remained unchanged. These data are of high relevance to understand the breadth of neuronal pathology that ensues in reward loci following ELS.",

The vagus nerve is dominated by afferent fibers that convey sensory information from the viscera to the brain. Most vagal afferents are unmyelinated, slow-conducting C-fibers, while a smaller portion are myelinated, fast-conducting A-fibers. Vagal afferents terminate in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) in the dorsal brainstem and regulate autonomic and respiratory reflexes, as well as ascending pathways throughout the brain. Vagal afferents form glutamatergic excitatory synapses with postsynaptic NTS neurons that are modulated by a variety of channels. The organization of vagal afferents with regard to fiber type and channels is not well understood. In the present study, we used tract tracing methods to identify distinct populations of vagal afferents to determine if key channels are selectively localized to specific groups of afferent fibers. Vagal afferents were labeled with isolectin B4 (IB4) or cholera toxin B (CTb) to detect unmyelinated and myelinated afferents, respectively. We find that TRPV1 channels are preferentially found in unmyelinated vagal afferents identified with IB4, with almost half of all IB4 fibers showing co-localization with TRPV1. These results agree with prior electrophysiological findings. In contrast, we found that the ATP-sensitive channel P2X3 is found in a subset of both myelinated and unmyelinated vagal afferent fibers. Specifically, 18% of IB4 and 23% of CTb afferents contained P2X3. The majority of CTb-ir vagal afferents contained neither channel. Since neither channel was found in all vagal afferents, there are likely further degrees of heterogeneity in the modulation of vagal afferent sensory input to the NTS beyond fiber type.",

In addition, some of these immunoreactive puncta seemed to be associated with tanycyte processes that were labeled with anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) monoclonal antibody. Ependymal cells were also found to be immunopositive for GLUT5. Furthermore, several noticeable GLUT5 immunoreactive profiles were observed. GLUT5 immunoreactive neurons, confirmed by double staining with neuronal nuclei (NeuN), were seen in the entopeduncular nucleus and lateral hypothalamus. Cerebellar Purkinje cells were immunopositve for GLUT5. Dense accumulation of immunoreactive puncta, some of which were neuronal elements (confirmed by immunoelectron microscopy), were observed in the optic tract and their terminal fields, namely, superior colliculus, pretectum, nucleus of the optic tract, and medial terminal nucleus of the optic tract. In addition to the associated areas of the visual system, the vestibular and cochlear nuclei also contained dense GLUT5 immunoreactive puncta. Western blot analysis of the cerebellum indicated that the antibody used recognized the 33.5 and 37.0kDa bands that were also contained in jejunum and kidney extracts.

Our previous studies suggested a possible role for the opioidergic mediation of reproductive stress response in fish. In the present investigation, by immunocytochemical approach, we studied the distribution of -endorphin (-EP) secreting neurons in the brain of the tilapia Oreochromis mossambicus exposed to aquacultural stressors. Intensely stained -EP immunoreactive neurons were encountered in the nucleus lateralis tuberis (NLT) region during previtellogenic and vitellogenic phases in both controls and in fish exposed to aquacultural stressors. Furthermore, at the end of the prespawning phase in controls, weak staining in -EP neurons was accompanied by intensely stained luteinizing hormone (LH) immunoreactive cells in the proximal pars distalis (PPD) of the pituitary gland and a significantly higher gonadosomatic and hepatosomatic indices, suggesting the attenuation of inhibitory effect of -EP on reproductive axis prior to spawning. However, in fish exposed to stressors, several darkly stained -EP immunoreactive cells with dense fibre projections towards the hypothalamo-hypophysial tract were concomitant with weakly immunoreactive LH content in the PPD of the pituitary gland and a significantly lower gonadosomatic and hepatosomatic indices compared to those of controls.

Peripheral neuropathies (PNs) are injuries or diseases of the nerves which arise from varied aetiology, including metabolic disease, trauma and drug toxicity. The clinical presentation depends on the type of neuropathy, and may include the loss of motor, sensory and autonomic functions, or development of debilitating neuropathic pain distal to the injury site. It can be challenging to identify the aetiology of PNs, as the clinical syndromes are often indistinct. However, the mechanisms that underlie pathological changes in peripheral neuropathy are fundamentally different, depending on the trigger. This review focuses on the axonopathy observed in two frequently encountered forms of peripheral neuropathy, diabetic neuropathy and chemotherapy-induced neuropathy. A key manifestation of axonopathy in PN is the degeneration of terminal arbors of peripheral nerves, resulting in a loss of epidermal nerve fibres and inappropriate termination of nerve endings. Many symptoms of PN arise from aberrant termination of nerve endings, and the underlying axonopathy may be non-reversible, as nerve regeneration after injury and disease is often poor, absent, or aberrant. Directed guidance of terminal arbors back into the epidermis is therefore a suggested approach to treat peripheral neuropathy. This review will outline potential strategies to enhance and guide axonal regeneration and reinnervation in the skin. Using diabetic neuropathy and chemotherapy-induced neuropathy as specific examples, this review examines the setbacks encountered with the translation of growth factors into therapeutics for human neuropathy, and suggests a number of approaches for topical drug delivery.",

Results have shown that 20min pulse modulated radio-frequency radiation exposure of 900MHz and 1800MHz induces an effect and increases the permeability of blood-brain barrier of male rats. For females, 900MHz was found effective and it could be concluded that this result may due to the physiological differences between female and male animals.

Nerve growth factor (NGF) blocking therapies are an emerging and effective approach to pain management. However, concerns about the potential for adverse effects on the structure and function of the peripheral nervous system have slowed their development. Early studies using NGF antisera in adult rats reported effects on the size and number of neurons in the sympathetic chain ganglia. In the work described here, both young adult (68 week) and fully mature (78 month) rats were treated with muMab 911, a selective, murine, anti-NGF monoclonal antibody, to determine if systemic exposures to pharmacologically active levels of antibody for 1 month cause loss of neurons in the sympathetic superior cervical ganglia (SCG). State-of-the-art, unbiased stereology performed by two independent laboratories was used to determine the effects of muMab 911 on SCG neuronal number and size, as well as ganglion size. Following muMab 911 treatment, non-statistically significant trends toward smaller ganglia, and smaller and fewer neurons, were seen when routine, nonspecific stains were used in stereologic assessments. However, when noradrenergic neurons were identified using tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity, trends toward fewer neurons observed with routine stains were not apparent. The only statistically significant effects detected were lower SCG weights in muMab 911-treated rats, and a smaller volume of TH immunoreactivity in neurons from younger rats treated with muMab 911.

Non-thermal microwave/lower frequency electromagnetic fields (EMFs) act via voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) activation. Calcium channel blockers block EMF effects and several types of additional evidence confirm this mechanism. Low intensity microwave EMFs have been proposed to produce neuropsychiatric effects, sometimes called microwave syndrome, and the focus of this review is whether these are indeed well documented and consistent with the known mechanism(s) of action of such EMFs. VGCCs occur in very high densities throughout the nervous system and have near universal roles in release of neurotransmitters and neuroendocrine hormones. Soviet and Western literature shows that much of the impact of non-thermal microwave exposures in experimental animals occurs in the brain and peripheral nervous system, such that nervous system histology and function show diverse and substantial changes. These may be generated through roles of VGCC activation, producing excessive neurotransmitter/neuroendocrine release as well as oxidative/nitrosative stress and other responses. Excessive VGCC activity has been shown from genetic polymorphism studies to have roles in producing neuropsychiatric changes in humans. Two U.S. government reports from the 1970s to 1980s provide evidence for many neuropsychiatric effects of non-thermal microwave EMFs, based on occupational exposure studies. 18 more recent epidemiological studies, provide substantial evidence that microwave EMFs from cell/mobile phone base stations, excessive cell/mobile phone usage and from wireless smart meters can each produce similar patterns of neuropsychiatric effects, with several of these studies showing clear doseresponse relationships. Lesser evidence from 6 additional studies suggests that short wave, radio station, occupational and digital TV antenna exposures may produce similar neuropsychiatric effects. Among the more commonly reported changes are sleep disturbance/insomnia, headache, depression/depressive symptoms, fatigue/tiredness, dysesthesia, concentration/attention dysfunction, memory changes, dizziness, irritability, loss of appetite/body weight, restlessness/anxiety, nausea, skin burning/tingling/dermographism and EEG changes. In summary, then, the mechanism of action of microwave EMFs, the role of the VGCCs in the brain, the impact of non-thermal EMFs on the brain, extensive epidemiological studies performed over the past 50 years, and five criteria testing for causality, all collectively show that various non-thermal microwave EMF exposures produce diverse neuropsychiatric effects.",

Although best known as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), tamoxifen is a drug with a wide range of activities. Tamoxifen has demonstrated some efficacy has a therapeutic for bipolar mania and is believed to exert these effects through inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC). As the symptoms of amphetamine treatment in rodents are believed to mimic the symptoms of a manic episode, many of the preclinical studies for this indication have demonstrated that tamoxifen inhibits amphetamine action. The amphetamine-induced increase in extracellular dopamine which gives rise to the manic effects is due to interaction of amphetamine with the dopamine transporter. We and others have demonstrated that PKC reduces amphetamine-induced reverse transport through the dopamine transporter. In this review, we will outline the actions of tamoxifen as a SERM and further detail another known action of tamoxifeninhibition of PKC. We will summarize the literature showing how tamoxifen affects amphetamine action. Finally, we will present our hypothesis that tamoxifen, or an analog, could be used therapeutically to reduce amphetamine abuse in addition to treating mania.",

The purpose of the present study was to determine the response of the porcine coeliac-superior mesenteric ganglion complex (CSMG) neurons projecting to the prepyloric area of the porcine stomach to peripheral neuronal damage following partial stomach resection. To identify the sympathetic neurons innervating the studied area of stomach, the neuronal retrograde tracer Fast Blue (FB) was applied to control and partial stomach resection (RES) groups. On the 22nd day after FB injection, following laparotomy, the partial resection of the previously FB-injected stomach prepyloric area was performed in animals of RES group. On the 28th day, all animals were re-anaesthetized and euthanized. The CSMG complex was then collected and processed for double-labeling immunofluorescence. In control animals, retrograde-labelled perikarya were immunoreactive to tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine -hydroxylase (DH), neuropeptide Y (NPY) and galanin (GAL). Partial stomach resection decreased the numbers of FB-positive neurons immunopositive for TH and DH. However, the strong increase of NPY and GAL expression, as well as de novo-synthesis of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and leu5-Enkephalin (LENK) was noted in studied neurons.

Inevitably though, ageing results in a cognitive and sensory-motor decline caused by changes in neuronal structure and function. Besides normal ageing, age-related pathological conditions can develop in a sizeable proportion of the population. While this wide array of diseases are considerably different compared to physiological ageing, the two processes share many similarities and are likely to interact.

The purpose of this article is to come out with the drug that can travel through tranvascular route by self supporting transporter mechanism.This is achieved with support of increase in number of fluorine atoms in the (S)-(+)-2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrrolo[2,1c[1,4]benzodiazepine5,11(10H,11aH)-dione.Synthesized compound examined by IR, 1H, 13C NMR, HRMS, HRTEM analysis and in vitro evaluation.New compound exhibited as minimal toxicity comparable to the standard drug.The need for the synthesis of an external nano drug carrying agent is complimented. Drug therapy of seizures involves producing high levels of antiepileptic drugs in the blood. Drug must enter the brain by crossing from the blood into the brain tissue, called a transvascular route (TVR). Even before the drug can reach the brain tissue, factors such as systemic toxicity, macrophage phagocytises and reduction in oxygen content limit the success of this TVR. Encapsulating the drug within a nano scale delivering system, synthesising drugs with low molecular weight are the best mechanisms to deliver the drug to the brain.

By this way, reducing the toxicity of BDZ than the conventional anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), increasing the solubility, reducing the melting point, enriching the TVR with excess oxygen content with the support of fluorine. With all these important prerequisites fulfilled, the drug along with the attached molecule is expected to travel more comfortably through the TVR without any external support than any other conventional AEDs.

Interneurons of the cerebral cortex play a significant role in cortical information processing and are of clinical interest due to their involvement in neurological disorders. In the human neocortex, three subsets of interneurons can be identified based on the production of the calcium-binding proteins parvalbumin, calretinin or calbindin. A subset of interneurons in the mouse cortex expresses the serotonin 3A receptor (5-HT3AR). Previous work in humans has also demonstrated the presence of a subgroup of cortical neurons that produces the catecholaminergic enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Many TH-producing cells in the rat cortex coexpress calretinin and are adjacent to blood vessels. However, little is known about the phenotype of these TH interneurons in humans. Here we immunohistochemically examined the coexpression of TH with parvalbumin, calretinin, calbindin or 5-HT3AR in human Brodmanns areas 10 and 24, cortical regions with high densities of TH-containing neurons. Colocalization of TH with these calcium-binding proteins and with 5-HT3AR was not detected in either area. Cortical TH cells were rarely apposed to blood vessels, denoted by immunolabeling for the gliovascular marker aquaporin-4.

Ethanol is a macronutrient whose intake is a form of ingestive behavior, sharing physiological mechanisms with food intake. Chronic ethanol consumption is detrimental to the brain, inducing gender-dependent neuronal damage. The hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARN) is a modulator of food intake that expresses feeding-regulatory neuropeptides, such as alpha melanocyte-stimulating hormone (-MSH) and neuropeptide Y (NPY). Despite its involvement in pathways associated with eating disorders and ethanol abuse, the impact of ethanol consumption and withdrawal in the ARN structure and neurochemistry in females is unknown. We used female rat models of 20% ethanol consumption for six months and of subsequent ethanol withdrawal for two months. Food intake and body weights were measured. ARN morphology was stereologically analyzed to estimate its volume, total number of neurons and total number of neurons expressing NPY, -MSH, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and estrogen receptor alpha (ER). Ethanol decreased energy intake and body weights. However, it did not change the ARN morphology or the expression of NPY, -MSH and TH, while increasing ER expression. Withdrawal induced a significant volume and neuron loss that was accompanied by an increase in NPY expression without affecting -MSH and TH expression. These findings indicate that the female ARN is more vulnerable to withdrawal than to excess alcohol. The data also support the hypothesis that the same pathways that regulate the expression of NPY and -MSH in long-term ethanol intake may regulate food intake. The present model of long-term ethanol intake and withdrawal induces new physiological conditions with adaptive responses.",

As stroke therapies are still limited to a minority of patients, efforts have been intensified to an improved understanding of pathophysiological processes during ischemia formation, potentially allowing the development of specific therapeutic interventions. In this context, cytoskeletal elements became evident as key players during the transition process towards long-lasting tissue damage. This study focused on ischemia-related alterations of the cytoskeleton with a special focus on microtubule-associated proteins and neurofilament light chains (NF-L). Immunohistochemical analyses were applied to brain sections of mice and rats after experimental stroke and to autoptic samples from a stroke patient. To consider translational aspects, a thromboembolic model of stroke in rats, closely mimicking the human situation, was used in addition to the filament-based model of focal cerebral ischemia in mice. One day after ischemia onset, immunoreactivity of microtubule-associated protein tau and microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP2) was reduced in ischemic areas. These findings were consistently present in the ischemia-affected striatum and the neocortex. In a quite opposite fashion, ischemic areas displayed NF-L-immunoreactivity in neuropathologically altered fibers, local agglomerations probably related to degraded cell bodies and neocortical pyramidal cells. Notably, up-regulation of NF-L was also confirmed in infarcted tissue from a human brain sample. Furthermore, analyses of rodent brain tissue revealed corkscrew curl-like fibers as a special feature of MAP2 in the ischemia-affected hippocampus. In conclusion, this study provides evidence for an opposite reaction of microtubule-associated proteins and neurofilaments after focal cerebral ischemia. Accordingly, cytoskeletal elements appear as a promising target for stroke treatment.",

The physical structure of neurons  dendrites converging on the soma, with an axon conveying activity to distant locations  is uniquely tied to their function. To perform their role, axons need to maintain structural precision in the soft, gelatinous environment of the central nervous system and the dynamic, flexible paths of nerves in the periphery. This requires close mechanical coupling between axons and the surrounding tissue, as well as an elastic, robust axoplasm resistant to pinching and flattening, and capable of sustaining transport despite physical distortion. These mechanical properties arise primarily from the properties of the internal cytoskeleton, coupled to the axonal membrane and the extracellular matrix. In particular, the two large constituents of the internal cytoskeleton, microtubules and neurofilaments, are braced against each other and flexibly interlinked by specialised proteins. Recent evidence suggests that the primary function of neurofilament sidearms is to structure the axoplasm into a linearly organised, elastic gel. This provides support and structure to the contents of axons in peripheral nerves subject to bending, protecting the relatively brittle microtubule bundles and maintaining them as transport conduits. Furthermore, a substantial proportion of axons are myelinated, and this thick jacket of membrane wrappings alters the form, function and internal composition of the axons to which it is applied. Together these structures determine the physical properties and integrity of neural tissue, both under conditions of normal movement, and in response to physical trauma. The effects of traumatic injury are directly dependent on the physical properties of neural tissue, especially axons, and because of axons extreme structural specialisation, post-traumatic effects are usually characterised by particular modes of axonal damage. The physical realities of axons in neural tissue are integral to both normal function and their response to injury, and require specific consideration in evaluating research models of neurotrauma.",

The differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) into acetylcholine secreted motor neuron-like cells, followed by elongation of the cell axon, is a promising treatment for spinal cord injury and motor neuron cell dysfunction in mammals. Differentiation is induced through a pre-induction step using Beta- mercaptoethanol (BME) followed by four days of induction with retinoic acid and sonic hedgehog. This process results in a very efficient differentiation of BM-MSCs into motor neuron-like cells. Immunocytochemistry showed that these treated cells had specific motor neural markers: microtubule associated protein-2 and acetylcholine transferase. The ability of these cells to function as motor neuron cells was assessed by measuring acetylcholine levels in a culture media during differentiation. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) showed that the differentiated cells were functional. Motor neuron axon elongation was then induced by adding different concentrations of a nerve growth factor (NGF) to the differentiation media. Using a collagen matrix to mimic the natural condition of neural cells in a three-dimensional model showed that the MSCs were successfully differentiated into motor neuron-like cells.

One-way ANOVA was used to compare results among treatment groups. Lead-exposed pups exhibited a significant decrease in somal size compared to controls (P<0.01) that was reversed by cotreatment with ascorbic acid. Sholls analysis revealed a significant increase in apical dendritic branch points near cell body (P<0.05) and a decreased total dendritic length in both apical and basal dendritic trees of CA1 neurons (P<0.05).

One group of male Wistar rats (290300g) with bilateral stainless steel LPBN cannulas was used to test the effects of a GABAC receptor agonist and antagonist on the fluid intake and cardiovascular parameters. We investigated the effects of bilateral LPBN injections of trans-4-aminocrotonic acid (TACA) on the intake of water and 0.3M NaCl induced by acute fluid depletion (subcutaneous injection of Furo/Cap). c-Fos expression increased (P<0.05), suggesting LPBN neuronal activation. The injection of different doses of TACA (0.5, 2.0 and 160 nmol) in the LPBN did not change the sodium or water intake in Furo/Cap-treated rats (P>0.05). Treatment with the GABAC receptor antagonist (Z)-3-[(aminoiminomethyl)thio]prop-2-enoic acid sulfate (ZAPA, 10nmol) or with ZAPA (10nmol) plus TACA (160nmol) did not change the sodium or water intake compared with that for vehicle (saline) (P>0.05). Bilateral injections of the GABAC agonist in the LPBN of Furo/Cap-treated rats did not affect the mean arterial pressure (MAP) or heart rate (HR). The GABAC receptor expression in the LPBN was confirmed by the presence of a 50kDa band. Although LPBN neurons might express GABAC receptors, their activation produced no change in water and sodium intake or in the cardiovascular parameters in the acute fluid depletion rats. Therefore, the GABAC receptors in the LPBN might not interfere with fluid and blood pressure regulation.",

Plasma membrane monoamine transporter (PMAT) is a newly discovered monoamine transporter belonging to the equilibrative nucleoside transporter family. Highly expressed in the brain, PMAT represents a major uptake2 transporter that may play a role in monoamine clearance. Although human PMAT has been functionally characterized at the molecular level, rodent models are often used to evaluate PMAT function in ex vivo and in vivo studies. The aim of this study was to examine if there is potential species difference in the functional characteristics of PMAT between human, rat and mouse. A set of transfected cells stably expressing human PMAT (MDCK/hPMAT), rat Pmat (MDCK/rPmat) and mouse Pmat (Flp293/mPmat) were constructed. In MDCK/hPMAT, MDCK/rPmat and Flp293/mPmat cells, cellular localization analyses revealed that hPMAT, rPmat and mPmat are expressed and mainly localized to the plasma membranes of cells. The uptake of MPP+, serotonin and dopamine by MDCK/hPMAT, MDCK/rPmat and Flp293/mPmat cells was significantly increased compared with those by the mock transfection control. In contrast, two nucleosides, uridine and adenosine, minimally interacted with PMAT/Pmat in all species. The hPMAT-, rPmat- and mPmat-mediated uptakes of MPP+, serotonin and dopamine were saturable, with Km values of 33.7M, 70.2M and 49.5M (MPP+), 116M, 82.9M and 231M (serotonin), and 201M, 271M and 466M (dopamine), respectively, suggesting similar substrate affinities between human and rodent PMAT/Pmat. The prototypical inhibitors, decynium 22 and GBR12935, also showed similar inhibition potencies between species. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated interspecies similarities in the functional characteristics of human and rodent PMAT/Pmat, which indicate a practical utility of rat and mouse animal models for further investigating and extrapolating the in vivo function of PMAT in humans.",

The emerging role of neuronal activity in regulating oligodendrocyte progenitor cell behavior during developmental myelination has opened up an exciting possibilitya role for neuronal activity in the early stages of remyelination.

These cells are electrically active and can be depolarized, suggesting that neuronal activity may have a modulatory role in their development and remyelination potential.

It is widely known that the catecholamine group is formed by dopamine, noradrenaline and adrenaline. Its synthesis is regulated by the enzyme called tyrosine hydroxylase. 3-hydroxytyramine/dopamine (DA) is a precursor of noradrenaline and adrenaline synthesis and acts as a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. The three main nuclei, being the retrorubral field (A8 group), the substantia nigra pars compacta (A9 group) and the ventral tegmental area (A10 group), are arranged in the die-mesencephalic portion and are involved in three complex circuitries  the mesostriatal, mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways. These pathways are involved in behavioral manifestations, motricity, learning, reward and also in pathological conditions such as Parkinsons disease and schizophrenia. The aim of this study was to perform a morphological analysis of the A8, A9 and A10 groups in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus  a neotropical primate), whose morphological and functional characteristics support its suitability for use in biomedical research. Coronal sections of the marmoset brain were submitted to Nissl staining and TH-immunohistochemistry. The morphology of the neurons made it possible to subdivide the A10 group into seven distinct regions: interfascicular nucleus, raphe rostral linear nucleus and raphe caudal linear nucleus in the middle line; paranigral and parainterfascicular nucleus in the middle zone; the rostral portion of the ventral tegmental area nucleus and parabrachial pigmented nucleus located in the dorsolateral portion of the mesencephalic tegmentum. The A9 group was divided into four regions: substantia nigra compacta dorsal and ventral tiers; substantia nigra compacta lateral and medial clusters. No subdivisions were made for the A8 group. These results reveal that A8, A9 and A10 are phylogenetically stable across species. As such, further studies concerning such divisions are necessary in order to evaluate the occurrence of subdivisions that express DA in other primate species, with the aim of characterizing its functional relevance.",

Sprouty-related protein-2 (Spred-2) is a negative regulator of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) pathway, which is important for cell proliferation, neuronal differentiation, plasticity and survival. Nevertheless, its general molecular characteristics such as gene expression patterns and potential role in neural repair in the brain remain unknown. Thus, this study aimed to characterise the expression of spred-2 in the zebrafish brain. Digoxigenin-in situ hybridization showed spred-2 mRNA-expressing cells were mainly seen in the proliferative zones such as the olfactory bulb, telencephalon, optic tectum, cerebellum, and the dorsal and ventral hypothalamus, and most of which were neuronal cells. To evaluate the potential role of spred-2 in neuro-regeneration, spred-2 gene expression was examined in the dorsal telencephalon followed by mechanical-lesion. Real-time PCR showed a significant reduction of spred-2 mRNA levels in the telencephalon on 1-day till 2-days post-lesion and gradually increased to normal levels as compared with intact. Furthermore, to confirm involvement of Spred-2 signalling in the cell proliferation after brain injury, double-labelling of spred-2 in-situ hybridization with immunofluorescence of BrdU and phosphorylated-ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2), a downstream of Spred-2 was performed. Increase of BrdU and p-ERK1/2 immunoreactive cells suggest that a decrease in spred-2 after injury might associated with activation of the ERK pathway to stimulate cell proliferation in the adult zebrafish brain.

Parkinsons disease (PD) affects the A9 dopaminergic (DA) neurons of substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) whereas other DA neuronal subtypes are spared. The role of calbindin in this differential vulnerability has been long elicited, and is seen in the MPTP induced mice models of PD. A peculiar feature of mice models is the strain specific differences in the susceptibility to MPTP. Here, calbindin-D28K expression in DA neurons of SNpc of MPTP susceptible C57BL/6 mice and MPTP resistant CD-1 mice was studied as a susceptibility marker of degeneration. Unbiased stereological estimation of immunoperoxidase stained midbrain sections revealed significantly higher number of calbindin immunoreactive cells in SNpc of CD-1 mice compared to that of C57BL/6 strain. Western blotting showed minimal differences in the levels. Calbindintyrosine hydroxylase immunofluorescence co-labeling was performed to map the calbindin immunoreactive DA neurons in SNpc and ventral tegmental area (VTA) and to quantify the calbindin expression at cellular level. While the levels were comparable in VTA of both mice strains, the SNpc of CD-1 mice showed significantly higher calbindin expression. Within the SNpc, the medial and dorsal subdivisions showed higher calbindin expression in CD-1. The expression in the ventrolateral SNpc of both strains remained comparable. Our observations clearly point at overall higher levels and sizeable percentage of cells expressing more calbindin in SNpc of CD-1 mice, which might confer neuroprotection against MPTP, while its lower expression makes C57BL/6 mice more susceptible.

A guidance channel was implanted at the lesion site. This channel was seeded with native Schwann cells or Schwann cells that had been previously transduced with a lentiviral vector carrying the GDNF gene. Thereafter, these experiences were reproduced in animals injected with lentiviral vectors carrying a shRNA for GFAP (Lv-shGFAP), which has recently been shown to block glial scar formation.Functional evaluations showed that Lv-shGFAP induced a significant improvement in recovery in animals grafted with Schwann cells. Histological studies demonstrated the outgrowth of axons in the guidance channel containing Schwann cells transduced or not with GDNF. This axonal growth was enhanced in rats receiving Lv-shGFAP vector. Also, a significant increase of serotonergic innervation of the injured hemicord, distal to the lesion, was found only in animals treated with Lv-shGFAP vectors.Importantly, this study confirms that glial scar formation is a major impediment for axonal sprouting after spinal cord injury, and emphasizes the importance of serotonergic innervation for locomotor function.

The mutant SOD1G93A mouse replicates many features of the disease, however the sequence of events resulting in degeneration of the neuromuscular circuitry remains unknown. Furthermore, despite widespread degenerative neuronal pathology throughout the spinal cord in this model, hindlimb motor function is lost before forelimb function. We investigated axons and NMJs in the hindlimb (gastrocnemius) and forelimb (extensor) muscles in the high copy number mutant SOD1G93AxYFP (yellow fluorescent protein) mouse. We found that distal axonal and NMJ alterations were present prior to previously reported functional symptom onset in this strain. Indeed, increased branch complexity as well as colocalisation between pre- and post-synaptic markers indicated widespread early axonal and NMJ alterations in the hindlimb. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that the colocalisation of the scaffolding proteins nestin, LRP-4, dystrophin and rapsyn were diminished before post-synaptic receptors in the gastrocnemius, and the degree of loss differed between proteins. Analysis of the forelimb muscle revealed axonal and NMJ degeneration at a late, post symptomatic stage, as well as novel differences in NMJ morphology, with reduced complexity. Furthermore, post-synaptic scaffolding proteins were preserved in the forelimb compared with the hindlimb. Analysis of protein levels indicated an increase in LRP-4, dystrophin and rapsyn in post symptomatic skeletal muscle that may suggest ongoing attempts at repair. This study indicates that axonal and NMJ degeneration in the SOD1 model of ALS is a complex and evolving sequence of events.

BackgroundThe hippocampus, central amygdaloid nucleus and the ventromedial region (marginal division) of the striatum have been reported to be involved in the mechanism of learning and memory. This study aimed elucidating anatomical and functional connections among these brain areas during learning and memory. ResultsIn the first part of this study, the c-Fos protein was used to explore functional connections among these structures. Chemical stimulation of either hippocampus or central amygdaloid nucleus results in dense expression of c-Fos protein in nuclei of neurons in the marginal division of the striatum, indicating that the hippocampus and the central amygdaloid nucleus might be functionally connected with the marginal division. In the second part of the study, the cholera toxin subunit B-horseradish peroxidase was injected into the central amygdaloid nucleus to observe anatomical connections among them. The retrogradely transported conjugated horseradish peroxidase was observed in neurons of both the marginal division and dorsal part of the hippocampus following the injection. Hence, neural fibers from both the marginal division and the hippocampus directly projected to the central amygdaloid nucleus. ConclusionThe results implicated potential new functional and structural pathways through these brain areas during the process of learning and memory.

The antidepressant-sensitive norepinephrine (NE) transporter (NET) inactivates NE released during central and peripheral neuronal activity by transport into presynaptic cells. Altered NE clearance due to dysfunction of NET has been associated with the development of mental illness and cardiovascular diseases. NET activity in vivo is influenced by stress, neuronal activity, hormones and drugs. We investigated the mechanisms of Ca2+ regulation of NET and found that Ca2+ influenced both Vmax and Km for NE transport into cortical synaptosomes. Changes in extracellular Ca2+ triggered rapid and bidirectional surface trafficking of NET expressed in cultured cells. Deletion of residues 2847 in the NET NH2-terminus abolished the Ca2+ effect on surface trafficking. Mutagenesis studies identified Thr30 in this region as the essential residue for both Ca2+- dependent phosphorylation and trafficking of NET. Depolarization of excitable cells increased surface NET in a Thr30 dependent manner. A proteomic analysis, RNA interference, and pharmacological inhibition supported roles of CaMKI and CaMKII in Ca2+-modulated NE transport and NET trafficking. Depolarization of primary noradrenergic neurons in culture with elevated K+ increased NET surface expression in a process that required external Ca2+ and depended on CaMK activity.

We aimed to evaluate the effect of 2100MHz radiofrequency radiation emitted by a generator, simulating a 3G-mobile phone on the brain of rats during 10 and 40 days of exposure. The female rats were randomly divided into four groups. Group I; exposed to 3G modulated 2100MHz RFR signal for 6h/day, 5 consecutive days/wk for 2 weeks, group II; control 10 days, were kept in an inactive exposure set-up for 6h/day, 5 consecutive days/wk for 2 weeks, group III; exposed to 3G modulated 2100MHz RFR signal for 6h/day, 5 consecutive days/wk for 8 weeks and group IV; control 40 days, were kept in an inactive exposure set-up for 6h/day, 5 consecutive days/wk for 8 weeks. After the genomic DNA content of brain was extracted, oxidative DNA damage (8-hydroxy-2deoxyguanosine, pg/mL) and malondialdehyde (MDA, nmoL/g tissue) levels were determined. Our main finding was the increased oxidative DNA damage to brain after 10 days of exposure with the decreased oxidative DNA damage following 40 days of exposure compared to their control groups. Besides decreased lipid peroxidation end product, MDA, was observed after 40 days of exposure. The measured decreased quantities of damage during the 40 days of exposure could be the means of adapted and increased DNA repair mechanisms.",

The present study examines the distribution of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity and its morphological relationships with neuropeptide Y (NPY)- and gonadoliberin (GnRH)-immunoreactive (IR) structures in the preoptic area (POA) of the male guinea pig. Tyrosine hydroxylase was expressed in relatively small population of perikarya and they were mostly observed in the periventricular preoptic nucleus and medial preoptic area. The tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive (TH-IR) fibers were dispersed troughout the whole POA. The highest density of these fibers was observed in the median preoptic nucleus, however, in the periventricular preoptic nucleus and medial preoptic area they were only slightly less numerous. In the lateral preoptic area, the density of TH-IR fibers was moderate. Two morphological types of TH-IR fibers were distinguished: smooth and varicose. Double immunofluorescence staining showed that TH and GnRH overlapped in the guinea pig POA but they never coexisted in the same structures. TH-IR fibers often intersected with GnRH-IR structures and many of them touched the GnRH-IR perikarya or dendrites. NPY wchich was abundantly present in the POA only in fibers showed topographical proximity with TH-IR structures. Althoug TH-IR perikarya and fibers were often touched by NPY-IR fibers, colocalization of TH and NPY in the same structures was very rare. There was only a small population of fibers which contained both NPY and TH. In conclusion, the morphological evidence of contacts between TH- and GnRH-IR nerve structures may be the basis of catecholaminergic control of GnRH release in the preoptic area of the male guinea pig. Moreover, TH-IR neurons were conatcted by NPY-IR fibers and TH and NPY colocalized in some fibers, thus NPY may regulate catecholaminergic neurons in the POA.",

The involvement of the VTA in these various behaviors and disorders is paralleled by its diverse signaling mechanisms. Here we review recent advances in our understanding of neuronal diversity in the VTA with a focus on cell phenotypes that participate in multiplexed neurotransmission involving distinct signaling mechanisms. First, we describe the cellular diversity within the VTA, including neurons capable of transmitting dopamine, glutamate or GABA as well as neurons capable of multiplexing combinations of these neurotransmitters. Next, we describe the complex synaptic architecture used by VTA neurons in order to accommodate the transmission of multiple transmitters. We specifically cover recent findings showing that VTA multiplexed neurotransmission may be mediated by either the segregation of dopamine and glutamate into distinct microdomains within a single axon or by the integration of glutamate and GABA into a single axon terminal. In addition, we discuss our current understanding of the functional role that these multiplexed signaling pathways have in the lateral habenula and the nucleus accumbens. Finally, we consider the putative roles of VTA multiplexed neurotransmission in synaptic plasticity and discuss how changes in VTA multiplexed neurons may relate to various psychopathologies including drug addiction and depression.",

Brains of insectivores were coronally sectioned and immunohistochemically stained with antibodies against choline acetyltransferase, tyrosine hydroxylase, serotonin and orexin-A. The majority of nuclei were similar among the species investigated and to mammals in general, but certain differences in the nuclear complement highlighted potential phylogenetic interrelationships. In the cholinergic system, the three shrew species lacked parabigeminal and EdingerWestphal nuclei. In addition, the appearance of the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus in all insectivores revealed a mediodorsal arch. All three of these features are the same as those present in microchiropterans.

The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis pars medialis (BSTM), medial preoptic nucleus (POM), and lateral septal region (LS) exhibit more vasotocin-immunoreactive (VT-ir) neural structures in male than in female adult quail. VT-ir cells and fibers in these regions are sensitive to gonadal steroids only in males. The insensitivity of adult female VT-ir neural structures to sex steroids is attributed to estradiol exposure during a critical period in embryonic life.Although the VT-ir system has been intensively examined in adult quail, information is limited in embryos and juveniles. Therefore, we herein investigated the development of VT-immunoreactive neural structures from embryonic day (E) 9 to adulthood with a particular focus on the BSTM, POM and LS of both sexes.VT-ir neural structures were more evident in female than in male embryos from E9 (BSTM and POM) and E11 (LS). This sex difference disappeared between E15 and post-hatch day 1 in the BSTM and POM, and during the first week of life in the LS. Male-biased sex differences in VT-ir structures appeared at puberty. Female-biased sexual dimorphism in the density of the VT-ir structures of BSTM was reflected by the stronger expression of VT mRNA in females than in males. However, the density of VT mRNA somata was comparable in the two sexes.The exposure of male embryos to estradiol resulted in the feminization of VT-ir neural structures in the BSTM, but not in the POM or LS at E11.Collectively, these results suggest that sex differences in VT-ir neural structures changes drastically throughout quail life.

In the last century, cognitive impairment in elderly people was considered as the consequence of neuronal death. However, later analyses indicated that age-related reduction in neuron number was limited to specific regions of the central nervous system, and was irrelevant to brain dysfunction in both humans and non-human animals. Recent studies have indicated that progressive diminution of neural plasticity across an individual's life span may underlie age-related brain dysfunction. To date, various factors have been shown to contribute to neural plasticity. In particular, substantial data supports the importance of production of new cells in the adult brain: the rate of hippocampal neurogenesis wanes radically during aging; similarly, white matter homeostasis via oligodendrogenesis is also affected by aging. This review briefly summarizes quantitative studies on adult hippocampal neurogenesis and oligodendrogenesis. Although the hippocampus is traditionally recognized as the memory center of the brain, it has started to emerge as an integrator of cognition and emotion. One of the current research highlights is that diverse functions of the hippocampus are topographically embedded along its longitudinal and transverse axes. Here we discuss alterations in adult neurogenesis and oligodendrogenesis during aging from a topographic view point. The quantitative anatomic approach to age-related alterations in production of new cells in the hippocampus may give a novel insight into how brain functions suffer from aging.",

Midcingulate cortex (MCC) has risen in prominence as human imaging identifies unique structural and functional activity therein and this is the first review of its structure, connections, functions and disease vulnerabilities. The MCC has two divisions (anterior, aMCC and posterior, pMCC) that represent functional units and the cytoarchitecture, connections and neurocytology of each is shown with immunohistochemistry and receptor binding. The MCC is not a division of anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the dorsal ACC designation is a misnomer as it incorrectly implies that MCC is a division of ACC. Interpretation of findings among species and developing models of human diseases requires detailed comparative studies which is shown here for five species with flat maps and immunohistochemistry (human, monkey, rabbit, rat, mouse). The largest neurons in human cingulate cortex are in layer Vb of area 24 d in pMCC which project to the spinal cord. This area is part of the caudal cingulate premotor area which is involved in multisensory orientation of the head and body in space and neuron responses are tuned for the force and direction of movement. In contrast, the rostral cingulate premotor area in aMCC is involved in action-reinforcement associations and selection based on the amount of reward or aversive properties of a potential movement. The aMCC is activated by nociceptive information from the midline, mediodorsal and intralaminar thalamic nuclei which evoke fear and mediates nocifensive behaviors. This subregion also has high dopaminergic afferents and high dopamine-1 receptor binding and is engaged in reward processes. Opposing pain/avoidance and reward/approach functions are selected by assessment of potential outcomes and error detection according to feedback-mediated, decision making. Parietal afferents differentially terminate in MCC and provide for multisensory control in an eye- and head-centric manner. Finally, MCC vulnerability in human disease confirms the unique organization of MCC and supports the predictive validity of the MCC dichotomy. Vulnerability of aMCC is shown in chronic pain, obsessive-compulsive disorder with checking symptoms and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and methylphenidate and pain medications selectively impact aMCC. In contrast, pMCC vulnerabilities are for progressive supranuclear palsy, unipolar depression and posttraumatic stress disorder.

A model in which the hypothalamus is placed in the most rostral portion of the neural tube, followed caudally by a diencephalon formed by prethalamus, thalamus and pretectum has been proposed. The adult thalamus and hypothalamus are quite unlike each other in connectivity and functions. Here we review work on the role of the secreted morphogen protein Sonic hedgehog (Shh) in the developing diencephalon and hypothalamic region to show how different these two regions are also from this point of view. Shh from the prechordal plate (PCP) induces and patterns the hypothalamus but there is no evidence that this role is fulfilled by a morphogen gradient. Later, the hypothalamic primordium itself expresses Shh and a large part of the hypothalamus belongs to the Shh lineage, including the ventral domains. Neural Shh is necessary to complete the specification (lateral hypothalamus), differentiation and growth of the hypothalamus. Although Gli2A is the major effector of Shh in this region, hypothalamic specification also depends on the suppression of Gli3R by Shh secreted by the PCP as well as the neuroepithelium. The thalamus is patterned by an Shh morphogen gradient originated in the ZLI following similar mechanisms to those in the spinal cord. The thalamus itself does not belong to the Shh lineage. Gli2A is necessary for appropriate growth and specification of the thalamic nuclei, to the exception of the medial and intralaminar groups (limbic-related), whose development depends on Gli3R. Beyond specification and patterning, the scarce data available about cell sorting and aggregation in these two regions shows key differences between them as well. In summary, not only expression patterns but also developmental mechanisms support a separation of the traditional thalamus and hypothalamus into different prosomeric domains.",

At E14, nerve fibers were observed along the medial border of the palatal shelves that tracked toward the epithelium.

The ability of neurons to change the amount or type of neurotransmitter they use, or neurotransmitter plasticity, is an emerging new form of adult brain plasticity. For example, it has recently been shown that neurons in the adult rat hypothalamus up- or down-regulate dopamine (DA) neurotransmission in response to the amount of light the animal receives (photoperiod), and that this in turn affects anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors (Dulcis et al., 2013). In this Chapter I consolidate recent evidence from my laboratory suggesting neurons in the adult mouse substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) also undergo DA neurotransmitter plasticity in response to persistent changes in their electrical activity, including that driven by the mouse's environment or behavior. Specifically, we have shown that the amounts of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH, the rate-limiting enzyme in DA synthesis) gene promoter activity, TH mRNA and TH protein in SNc neurons increases or decreases after 20h of altered electrical activity. Also, infusion of ion-channel agonists or antagonists into the midbrain for 2 weeks results in 10% (500 neurons) more or fewer TH immunoreactive (TH+) SNc neurons, with no change in the total number of SNc neurons (TH+ and TH). Targeting ion-channels mediating cell-autonomous pacemaker activity in, or synaptic input and afferent pathways to, SNc neurons are equally effective in this regard. In addition, exposing mice to different environments (sex pairing or environment enrichment) for 12 weeks induces 10% more or fewer TH+ SNc (and ventral tegmental area or VTA) neurons and this is abolished by concurrent blockade of synaptic transmission in midbrain. Although further research is required to establish SNc (and VTA) DA neurotransmitter plasticity, and to determine whether it alters brain function and behavior, it is an exciting prospect because: (1) It may play important roles in movement, motor learning, reward, motivation, memory and cognition; and (2) Imbalances in midbrain DA cause symptoms associated with several prominent brain and behavioral disorders such as schizophrenia, addiction, obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, Parkinsons disease and attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder. Midbrain DA neurotransmitter plasticity may therefore play a role in the etiology of these symptoms, and might also offer new treatment options.",

In situ hybridization using a digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled RNA probe was used to identify the regional distribution of rem2 expression throughout the trout central nervous system, while real-time polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR) further supported these findings. Based on in situ hybridization, the regional distribution of rem2 occurred within each major subdivision of the brain and included large populations of rem2 expressing cells in the dorsal telencephalon of the cerebrum, the internal cellular layer of the olfactory bulb, and the optic tectum of the midbrain. In contrast, no rem2 expressing cells were resolved within the cerebellum. These results were corroborated by rtPCR, where differential rem2 expression occurred between the major subdivisions assayed with the highest levels being found in the cerebrum, while it was nearly absent in the cerebellum. These data indicate that rem2 gene expression is broadly distributed and likely influences diverse functions in the adult fish central nervous system.",

The dopamine transporter (DAT) is a plasma membrane phosphoprotein that actively translocates extracellular dopamine (DA) into presynaptic neurons. The transporter is the primary mechanism for control of DA levels and subsequent neurotransmission, and is the target for abused and therapeutic drugs that exert their effects by suppressing reuptake. The transport capacity of DAT is acutely regulated by signaling systems and drug exposure, providing neurons the ability to fine-tune DA clearance in response to specific conditions. Kinase pathways play major roles in these mechanisms, and this review summarizes the current status of DAT phosphorylation characteristics and the evidence linking transporter phosphorylation to control of reuptake and other functions. Greater understanding of these processes may aid in elucidation of their possible contributions to DA disease states and suggest specific phosphorylation sites as targets for therapeutic manipulation of reuptake.",

Oxidative stress is a biochemical condition, which is defined by the imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the anti-oxidative defense. In this review, we evaluated available in vitro and in vivo studies carried out on the relation between RF emitted from mobile phones and oxidative stress. The results of the studies we reviewed here indicated that mobile phones and similar equipment or radars can be thought as a factor, which cause oxidative stress. Even some of them claimed that oxidative stress originated from radiofrequencies can be resulted with DNA damage.

The RF radiation was produced by a 900MHz cellular phone. Lipid peroxidation, which is the indicator of oxidative stress was quantified by measuring the formation of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). The glutathione (GSH) levels were determined by the Ellman method. Tissue total nitric oxide (NOx) levels were obtained using the Griess assay. Lipid peroxidation and NOx levels of brain tissue increased significantly in group II and III compared to group I. On the contrary, GSH levels were significantly lower in group II and III than group I. However, no statistically significant alterations in any of the endpoints were noted between group II and Group III.

We, thus, investigated chordin and noggin expression in the adult rat trigeminal nuclei using immunohistochemistry. Chordin and noggin were intensely expressed throughout the trigeminal nuclei. In addition, interesting differences are observed between chordin expression and noggin expression. For example, chordin prefers dendritic expression than noggin, suggesting that chordin is involved in the regulation of dendritic morphology and synaptic homeostasis. Furthermore, chordin and noggin were differentially expressed in the neuropil of the trigeminal nuclei. Since BMP signaling is known to play a pivotal role to make precise neural network, theses differences might be important to keep precise interneuronal connections by regulating local BMP signaling intensity in each region.

Large numbers of people are unknowingly exposed to electromagnetic fields (EMF) from wireless devices. Evidence exists for altered cerebellar development in association with prenatal exposure to EMF. However, insufficient information is still available regarding the effects of exposure to 900 megahertz (MHz) EMF during the prenatal period on subsequent postnatal cerebellar development. This study was planned to investigate the 32-day-old female rat pup cerebellum following exposure to 900MHz EMF during the prenatal period using stereological and histopathological evaluation methods. Pregnant rats were divided into control, sham and EMF groups. Pregnant EMF group (PEMFG) rats were exposed to 900MHz EMF for 1h inside an EMF cage during days 1321 of pregnancy. Pregnant sham group (PSG) rats were also placed inside the EMF cage during days 1321 of pregnancy for 1h, but were not exposed to any EMF. No procedure was performed on the pregnant control group (PCG) rats. Newborn control group (CG) rats were obtained from the PCG mothers, newborn sham group (SG) rats from the PSG and newborn EMF group (EMFG) rats from the PEMFG rats. The cerebellums of the newborn female rats were extracted on postnatal day 32. The number of Purkinje cells was estimated stereologically, and histopathological evaluations were also performed on cerebellar sections. Total Purkinje cell numbers calculated using stereological analysis were significantly lower in EMFG compared to CG (p<0.05) and SG (p<0.05). Additionally, some pathological changes such as pyknotic neurons with dark cytoplasm were observed in EMFG sections under light microscopy.

Retinoic acid (RA) is important during development, in neuronal plasticity, and also in peripheral nervous system regeneration. Here we use the frog visual system as a model to investigate the changes in RA signaling that take place after axonal injury to the central nervous system. Immunocytochemistry was used to localize different components of RA signaling within sections of the retina and optic tectum, namely, the synthetic enzyme retinaldehyde dehydrogenase (RALDH), the RA binding proteins CRABPI and II, the retinoic acid receptors RAR,  and , and finally the catabolic enzyme CYP26A1. The levels of these proteins were quantified in extracts of retina and tectum using Western blotting. Animals were studied at 1 week, 3 weeks and 6 weeks after optic nerve transection. At the latter time point the RGC axons were re-entering the optic tectum. All the components of RA signaling were present at low to moderate levels in retinas and tecta of control, unoperated animals. In retina, soon after optic nerve injury there was a large increase in RALDH, some increase in the CRABPs, and a large increase in RGC RAR and (expression. These increases continued as the RGC axons were regenerating, with the addition of later RAR expression at 6 weeks. At no stage did CYP26A1 expression significantly change. In the tectum the levels of RALDH increased after axotomy and during regrowth of axons (3 weeks), then decreased at 6 weeks, at which time the levels of CYP26A1 increased. Axotomy did not cause an immediate increase in tectal RAR levels but RAR and RAR increased after 3 weeks and RAR only after 6 weeks. These results are consistent with RA signaling playing an important role in the survival and regeneration of frog RGCs.",

It is a general consensus that stress is one of the major factors that suppresses growth. Previous studies revealed that the catecholaminergic and neuropeptide Y (NPY) systems, involved in the activation of stress-related neuronal circuits, influence growth hormone (GH)-release via modulating growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) secretion. Indeed, catecholaminergic and NPY-immunoreactive (IR) axon varicosities abut on the surface of the GHRH neurons forming contacts. These juxtapositions appear to be real synapses and may represent the morphological substrate of the impact of stress on growth. In addition to catecholamines and NPY, there is a vast amount of evidence that corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), a major stress hormone, also influences GH secretion. Whether this modulatory effect is direct, or indirect, via the hypothalamic GHRH system, has not been elucidated yet.In the present study, we examined the possibility that CRH influences GH secretion via modulating the GHRH release by direct synaptic mechanisms. Since the verification of these synapses by electron microscopy is problematic in human due to the long post mortem time, in order to reveal the putative CRH-GHRH juxtapositions, light microscopic double label immunohistochemistry was utilized. In the infundibular nucleus, a subset (6%) of the GHRH perikarya received abutting CRH fiber varicosities forming multiple contacts while passing by. No gaps appeared between the contacting elements. The morphology of these CRH-GHRH juxtapositions suggests that, among other neurotransmitters/neuromodulators, CRH influences growth by modulating the hypothalamic GHRH secretion via direct synaptic mechanisms.",

Neural stem cells (NSCs) of the olfactory epithelium (OE) are responsible for tissue maintenance and the neural regeneration after severe damage of the tissue. In the normal OE, NSCs are located in the basal layer, olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) mainly in the middle layer, and sustentacular (SUS) cells in the most apical olfactory layer. In this work, we induced severe damage of the OE through treatment with a zinc sulfate (ZnSO4) solution directly in the medium, which resulted in the loss of ORNs and SUS cells, but retention of the basal layer. During recovery following injury, the OE exhibited increased proliferation of NSCs and rapid neural regeneration. After 24h of recovery, new ORNs and SUS cells were observed. Normal morphology and olfactory function were reached after 168h (7 days) of recovery after ZnSO4 treatment. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that NSCs in the basal layer activate after OE injury and that these are sufficient for complete neural regeneration and olfactory function restoration.

We proposed that the difficulty in olfaction observed in the elderly may be due to an alteration in the number of dopaminergic neurons. Materials and methodsSections were taken from olfactory bulbs of post-mortem tissue specimens of 13 humans, males and females, aged from 19 to 63 years (35 and 50 years), with no history of neurological disorders. The tissues were fixed, embedded, cut on a freezing microtome, and prepared for immunohistochemical analysis using tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) antibodies. The number of positive neurons was counted. ResultsTH- and AADC-positive cells were present in the glomerular layer. There was no significant difference between the numbers of TH- and AADC-positive cells, in males and females, and in young and elderly individuals. The quantitative analysis revealed that the number of TH- and AADC-positive neurons were significantly higher in males than in females (P<0.05). Moreover, there was a significant increase in the number of TH- and AADC-positive neurons in the olfactory bulbs of the elderly compared with young individuals (P<0.05). ConclusionFactors such as gender and age may affect the number of dopaminergic neurons, and there is a correlation between increased dopaminergic neurons and olfactory performance. Moreover, the increase in dopaminergic cells in the olfactory bulb of the elderly may indicate the existence of rostral migratory stream in adult humans.",

The activity of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II alpha (CaMKII) may play a critical role in the modulation of nociceptor activity and plasticity of primary sensory trigeminal neurons. The aim of this study was to investigate the immunoreactivity of phosphorylated CaMKII (pCaMKII) in subpopulations of trigeminal ganglion (TG) neurons in rat models of early diabetes type 1 (dm1) and 2 (dm2). DM1 model was induced with intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected streptozotocin (STZ) (55mg/kg). DM2 rats were fed with the high fat diet (HFD) for 2 weeks and then received 35mg/kg of STZ i.p. Two weeks and 2 months after the STZ-diabetes induction, rats were sacrificed and immunohistochemical analysis for detection of pCaMKII immunoreactivity and double immunofluorescence labelling with isolectin (IB4) was performed. Increased intensity of pCaMKII immunofluorescence, restricted to IB4-negative small-diameter neurons, was seen in TG neurons two months after STZ-DM1 induction. DM1 model, as well as the obesity (control dm2 groups) resulted in neuronal impaired growth while dm2 model led to neuron hypertrophy in TG. Observed changes may play a critical role in the modulation of nociceptor activity and plasticity of primary sensory trigeminal neurons.

Eyes are the part of the circadian timekeeping system but not involved in the photoperiod regulated seasonal physiology in songbirds. Here, two experiments tested whether eyes detect and respond to seasonal change in the photoperiod environment, by examining gene and protein expressions in the retinas of redheaded buntings exposed to a single long day (LD, 16L:8D), with controls on short days (SD, 8L:16D). In the first experiment, mRNA expression of genes implicated in the light perception (opsins, rhodopsin, neuropsin, melanopsin, peropsin) and photoperiod induction (eya3, tsh-, dio2, dio3) was measured at hours 15 and 19 (hour 0=light on) on the first long day. There was a significant increase in the eya3, tsh- and dio2 mRNA expression, albeit with a temporal difference, and decrease in the neuropsin mRNA expression in buntings on the first long day. There was no change in the dio3, rhodopsin, melanopsin and peropsin mRNA expressions on exposure to long days. The second experiment immunohistochemically examined the eya3, tsh- and rhodopsin peptide expressions. eya3 was expressed in both light conditions, but with a significant higher levels in the retinal photoreceptor layer (PRL) under LD, as compared to SD. Similarly, tsh- was expressed in the PRL of LD retinas only. Rhodopsin levels were not significantly different between SD and LD conditions, however.

Despite this, orexinergic bouton density was lower in the cerebral cortex of the cetaceans studied compared to the artiodactyls studied, even when corrected for brain mass, neuron density, glial density and glial:neuron ratio.

PurposeTo determine hippocampal expression of neuronal GABA-transporter (GAT-1) and glial GABA-transporter (GAT-3) in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and hippocampal sclerosis (HS). MethodsHippocampal sections were immunohistochemically stained for GABA-transporter 1 and GABA-transporter-3, followed by quantification of the immunoreactivity in the hilus by optical density measurements. GABA-transporter 3 positive hilar cells were counted and GABA-transporter protein expression in sections that included all hippocampal subfields was quantified by Western blot.

Neuroinflammation is an early event and important contributor to the pathobiology of neurodegenerative diseases. Neuroglia, especially microglia, are a major central nervous system population that can modulate neuroinflammation. To determine potential key molecules in this process, we employed microarray analysis in the substantia nigra (SN) following medial forebrain bundle (MFB) transection and analyzed the temporal expression profiles of candidate genes implicated in neuroglial activation and functional maturation. The DNA microarray analyzed, 8913 probes. Sixty nine genes were up-regulated and 11 genes were down-regulated at least twofold compared to normal control. Of the 80 genes, 23 were related to cell metabolism, 3 related to apoptosis, 27 related to immunity. Among them, 4 genes (Galectin 3, Heat shock protein 27, Lipocalin 2, Tissue inhibitory metalloproteinase 1) seemed to be related to the neuroglial function. The candidate genes were subjected to quantitative real-time PCR, Western blotting, and immunohistochemical approaches. Expression changes similar to the microarray were evident. In a double immunofluorescence assay, Galectin 3 almost completely co-localized with OX6-positive activated microglia, and Heat shock protein 27 mainly co-localized with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) positive astrocytes. Lipocalin 2, except for a few matches of GFAP positive astrocytes, did not co-localized with any of neuroglial markers. This is the first study to evaluate gene expression changes in the SN following MFB transection, which has been used as a parkinsonian animal model.

Previous studies have shown that the effects of manual acupuncture (MA) are contributed by collagen fibers and mast cells in local acupoints, at which acupuncture stimulation causes various afferent fiber groups to be excited. However what happens in local nerve fibers and mast cells after MA remains unclear. The aim of this study was to examine the response of cutaneous nerve fibers and mast cells to MA stimulation in acupoint Hegu (LI4). The contralateral LI4 of the same rat was used as a non-stimulated control. Immnohistochemistry analysis were carried out to observe the expression of histamine (HA), serotonin (5-HT) and nociceptive neuropeptides, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P (SP), in the LI4 area. Mast cells were labeled with anti-mast cell tryptase antibody and simultaneously with HA or 5-HT primary antibodies to observe their co-expression. Our results showed that SP and CGRP were expressed more highly on the cutaneous nerve fibers of LI4 after MA stimulation than that of the control. Mast cells aggregated in close proximity to the blood vessels in intra-epidermis and dermis and some of them with degranulation in the lower dermis and subcutaneous tissue of LI4. Both mast cells and their granules appeared with HA (+) and 5-HT (+) expression at stimulated L14 sites, while a few intact mast cells with a little expression of 5-HT and HA were distributed in areas of non-stimulated L14. The results indicated that local cutaneous nerve terminals and mast cells responded to MA with higher expression of SP and CGRP in nerve fibers, as well as with aggregation and degranulation of mast cells with HA and 5-HT granules at acupoint LI4.

In addition, we observed that serotonin in axons of a terminal region were markedly decreased by aromatase inhibition and lack of estradiol (E) from metabolism of T. These observations implicated androgen receptors (AR) and estrogen receptors (ER) in the transduction of steroid hormone actions in serotonin neurons. Due to the longer treatment period employed, the expression of the cognate nuclear receptors was sought. We used single and double immunohistochemistry to quantitate and phenotypically localize AR, ER and ER in the dorsal raphe of male macaques. Male Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) were castrated for 57 months and then treated for 3 months with [1] placebo, [2] T, [3] DHT (non-aromatizable androgen) plus ATD (steroidal aromatase inhibitor), or [4] Flutamide (FLUT; androgen antagonist) plus ATD (n=5/group). After single labeling of each receptor, quantitative image analysis was applied and receptor positive neurons were counted. Double-label of raphe neurons for each receptor plus TPH2 determined whether the receptors were localized in serotonin neurons.

Rather, AR-positive nuclei were found in neighboring cells that are likely neurons. However, approximately 40% of dorsal raphe serotonin neurons contained ER or ER In conclusion, the stimulatory effect of androgens on TPH2 and SERT mRNA expression is mediated indirectly by neighboring neurons contain AR.

Although substantial changes in neuronal development were observed during the postnatal period, data concerning dynamics of nestin expression in the superior cervical ganglia (SCG) of rat during that period are lacking. It is known that gonadectomy and steroid hormones influence the development of neurons in the SCG during the postnatal period, but there are no data on how they influence the persistence of nestin expression in the SCG cells.The dynamics of nestin expression in the SCG in rats of three age groups, as well as the influence of gender and gonadectomy, was investigated.Three groups of male rats were sacrificed at 2, 3 and 6 months of age.

Intramural ganglia are present in the bladder wall of several species including human, pig, and guinea-pig. It has been suggested that there is a network of intramural ganglia in the bladder of these species that may be part of a motor-sensory system and receive afferent input. Prostaglandins (PG) have been suggested to play a role in this afferent signalling mechanism. To investigate the distribution of the prostaglandin E2 receptors EP1 and EP2 in and around intramural ganglia of the guinea pig, bladders of 6 guinea pigs were dissected, and processed for immunohistochemistry. Sections were examined for prostaglandin E2 receptor EP1- and EP2-immuno-reactivity and co-stained for vimentin, a marker for interstitial cells (IC) and cyclo-oxygenase 1 (COX I), the enzyme responsible for PG synthesis.Immunoreactivities for EP1 and EP2 were found in intramural ganglion cells. These cells were observed in between muscle bundles and on, or close to the serosal surface of the bladder. Furthermore, COX I was present in interstitial cells close to ganglion cells, indicating the possibility of a local synthesis of prostaglandins near the ganglia. The co-staining of EP1 or EP2 with vimentin showed that processes of interstitial cells run through the ganglia, often encircling or ensheathing cells.Therefore, it can be concluded that there is a close relationship between the intramural ganglia and the network of interstitial cells in the muscular layers of the bladder.

These results may indicate an interplay between the niche cells and fractones, which may result in the loss of neurogenesis during aging. In adulthood, the subventricular zone (SVZ) is one of the restricted places where neurogenesis persists. In this neurogenic niche, specialized extracellular matrix (ECM) structures termed fractones contact neural stem cells and their immediate progeny. Fractones are composed of ubiquitous ECM components including heparan sulfate proteoglycans such as perlecan and agrin. We have previously shown that fractones can capture growth factors and promote growth factor activity through a heparin binding mechanism in order to regulate neurogenesis. With aging, neurogenesis is known to decrease. However, the effect of aging on fractones structure and composition remains unknown. Here, we report that, while fractone number decreased, fractone size dramatically increased with aging. Despite the changes in fractones morphology, niche cells expressing glial fibrillary acidic protein kept direct contact with fractones. Furthermore, we have observed that heparan sulfate chains contained in fractones were modified with aging. However, FGF-2 was still captured by fractones via heparan sulfates.

We focused on PV because in cortical and hippocampal areas it is a marker of the fast-spiking interneurons which have an important role in the information transmission and processing. Soma area, perimeter and circularity were considered as morphological parameters to quantitatively group the PV positive somata by k-means clustering.The histological investigation revealed a superior pyramidoid puddle and a posterior puddle characterized by a cloud of neurons in its dorso-lateral part. Immunostaining showed positive somata and fibers throughout the rostro-caudal extent of the dog claustrum, localized principally in the dorsal region. k-Means clustering analysis enabled neuron classification according to size, identifying respectively big (radius=11.421.99m) and small (radius=6.331.08m) cells. No statistical differences in soma shape were observed. The topographical distribution of PV immunoreactivity suggests that the dog dorsal claustrum might be functionally related to the processing of visual inputs.Taken together our findings may help in the understanding the physiology of claustrum when compared with anatomical and functional data obtained in other species.",

The subdivisions of the medial geniculate complex can be distinguished based on the immunostaining of calcium-binding proteins and by the properties of the neurons within each subdivision. The possibility of changes in neurochemistry in this and other central auditory areas are important aspects to understand the basis that contributing to functional variations determined by environmental cycles or the animal's cycles of activity and rest. This study investigated, for the first time, day/night differences in the amounts of parvalbumin-, calretinin- and calbindin-containing neurons in the thalamic auditory center of a non-human primate, Sapajus apella. The immunoreactivity of the PV-IR, CB-IR and CR-IR neurons demonstrated different distribution patterns among the subdivisions of the medial geniculate. Moreover, a high number of CB- and CR-IR neurons were found during day, whereas PV-IR was predominant at night. We conclude that in addition to the chemical heterogeneity of the medial geniculate nucleus with respect to the expression of calcium-binding proteins, expression also varied relative to periods of light and darkness, which may be important for a possible functional adaptation of central auditory areas to environmental changes and thus ensure the survival and development of several related functions.",

G-protein-coupled calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) has been recently recognized as an important modulator of diverse cellular functions, beyond the regulation of systemic calcium homeostasis. To identify whether CaSR is involved in the pathophysiology of stroke, we studied the spatiotemporal regulation of CaSR protein expression in rats undergoing transient focal cerebral ischemia, which was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion. We observed very weak or negligible immunoreactivity for CaSR in the striatum of sham-operated rats, as well as in the contralateral striatum of ischemic rats after reperfusion. However, CaSR expression was induced in the ischemic and border zones of the lesion in ischemic rats. Six hours post-reperfusion there was an upregulation of CaSR in the ischemic zone, which seemed to decrease after seven days. This upregulation preferentially affected some neurons and cells associated with blood vessels, particularly endothelial cells and pericytes. In contrast, CaSR expression in the peri-infarct region was prominent three days after reperfusion, and with the exception of some neurons, it was mostly located in reactive astrocytes, up to day 14 after ischemia. On the other hand, activated microglia/macrophages in both the ischemic and border zones were devoid of specific labeling for CaSR at any time point after reperfusion, despite their massive infiltration in both regions. Our results show heterogeneity in CaSR-positive cells within the ischemic and border zones, suggesting that CaSR expression is regulated in response to the altered extracellular ionic environment caused by ischemic injury. Thus, CaSR may have a multifunctional role in the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke, possibly in vascular remodeling and astrogliosis.",

Fast-scan cyclic voltammetry is a powerful technique for monitoring rapid changes in extracellular neurotransmitter levels in the brain. In vivo fast-scan cyclic voltammetry has been used extensively in mammalian models to characterize dopamine signals in both anesthetized and awake preparations, but has yet to be applied to a non-mammalian vertebrate. The goal of this study was to establish in vivo fast-scan cyclic voltammetry in a songbird, the European starling, to facilitate real-time measurements of extracellular catecholamine levels in the avian striatum. In urethane-anesthetized starlings, changes in catecholamine levels were evoked by electrical stimulation of the ventral tegmental area and measured at carbonfiber microelectrodes positioned in the medial and lateral striata. Catecholamines were elicited by different stimulations, including trains related to phasic dopamine signaling in the rat, and were analyzed to quantify presynaptic mechanisms governing exocytotic release and neuronal uptake. Evoked extracellular catecholamine dynamics, maximal amplitude of the evoked catecholamine signal, and parameters for catecholamine release and uptake did not differ between striatal regions and were similar to those determined for dopamine in the rat dorsomedial striatum under similar conditions. Chemical identification of measured catecholamine by its voltammogram was consistent with the presence of both dopamine and norepinephrine in striatal tissue content. However, the high ratio of dopamine to norepinephrine in tissue content and the greater sensitivity of the carbonfiber microelectrode to dopamine compared to norepinephrine favored the measurement of dopamine. Thus, converging evidence suggests that dopamine was the predominate analyte of the electrically evoked catecholamine signal measured in the striatum by fast-scan cyclic voltammetry. Overall, comparisons between the characteristics of these evoked signals suggested a similar presynaptic regulation of dopamine in the starling and rat striatum. Fast-scan cyclic voltammetry thus has the potential to be an invaluable tool for investigating the neural underpinnings of behavior in birds.",

The present study describes the organization of the nuclei of the cholinergic, catecholaminergic, serotonergic and orexinergic systems in the brains of two members of Euarchontoglires, Lepus capensis and Tupaia belangeri. The aim of the present study was to investigate the nuclear complement of these neural systems in comparison to previous studies on Euarchontoglires and generally with other mammalian species. Brains were coronally sectioned and immunohistochemically stained with antibodies against choline acetyltransferase, tyrosine hydroxylase, serotonin and orexin-A. The majority of nuclei revealed in the current study were similar between the species investigated and to mammals generally, but certain differences in the nuclear complement highlight potential phylogenetic interrelationships within the Euarchontoglires and across mammals. In the northern tree shrew the nucleus of the trapezoid body contained neurons immunoreactive to the choline acetyltransferase antibody with some of these neurons extending into the lamellae within the superior olivary nuclear complex (SON). The cholinergic nature of the neurons of this nucleus, and the extension of cholinergic neurons into the SON, has not been noted in any mammal studied to date. In addition, cholinergic neurons forming the medullary tegmental field were also present in the northern tree shrew. Regarding the catecholaminergic system, the cape hare presented with the rodent specific rostral dorsal midline medullary nucleus (C3), and the northern tree shrew lacked both the ventral and dorsal divisions of the anterior hypothalamic group (A15v and A15d). Both species were lacking the primate/megachiropteran specific compact portion of the locus coeruleus complex (A6c). The nuclei of the serotonergic and orexinergic systems of both species were similar to those seen across most Eutherian mammals.

Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH, the rate limiting-enzyme in catecholamine synthesis) is regulated acutely via phosphorylation of 3 serine residuesSer19, 31 and 40, and chronically via changes in TH protein levels. In this study, we aimed to investigate how TH is regulated in the brain, gut and adrenal gland as well as changes in mature brain-derived neurotrophic factor (mBDNF) and proBDNF levels in a low-dose (2mg/kg, 5 days/week for 4 weeks) rotenone model of Parkinson's disease (PD). Rearing behaviour decreased by week 3 in the rotenone group (p<0.01), with further decreases in rearing by week 4 (p<0.001); however, TH remained unchanged in the substantia nigra (SN) and striatum; TH levels were also unaltered in other catecholaminergic cell groups of the brainstem such as A1C1 neurons or locus coeruleus. In the olfactory bulb, TH protein decreased (2.5-fold, p<0.01) while Ser31 phosphorylation increased (1.4-fold, p<0.05) in the rotenone group. In contrast, TH protein was increased in the adrenal gland (2-fold, p<0.05) and colon (5-fold, p<0.05) of rotenone rats. mBDNF levels were not changed in the SN but were significantly reduced in plasma and significantly increased in the colon (2-fold, p<0.01) of rotenone-treated rats. This is the first study to assess TH and BDNF in the brain and periphery in the rotenone model before SN/striatum degeneration is evident.

The oculomotor accessory nucleus, often referred to as the EdingerWestphal nucleus [EW], was first identified in the 17th century. Although its most well known function is the control of pupil diameter, some controversy has arisen regarding the exact location of these preganglionic neurons. Currently, the EW is thought to consist of two different parts. The first part [termed the preganglionic EWEWpg], which controls lens accommodation, choroidal blood flow and pupillary constriction, primarily consists of cholinergic cells that project to the ciliary ganglion. The second part [termed the centrally projecting EWEWcp], which is involved in non-ocular functions such as feeding behavior, stress responses, addiction and pain, consists of peptidergic neurons that project to the brainstem, the spinal cord and prosencephalic regions. However, in the literature, we found few reports related to either ascending or descending projections from the EWcp that are compatible with its currently described functions. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to systematically investigate the ascending and descending projections of the EW in the rat brain. We injected the anterograde tracer biotinylated dextran amine into the EW or the retrograde tracer cholera toxin subunit B into multiple EW targets as controls. Additionally, we investigated the potential EW-mediated innervation of neuronal populations with known neurochemical signatures, such as melanin-concentrating hormone in the lateral hypothalamic area [LHA] and corticotropin-releasing factor in the central nucleus of the amygdala [CeM].

Histidine decarboxylase (HDC) catalyzes the biosynthesis of histamine from l-histidine and is expressed throughout the mammalian nervous system by histaminergic neurons. Histaminergic neurons arise in the posterior mesencephalon during the early embryonic period and gradually develop into two histaminergic substreams around the lateral area of the posterior hypothalamus and the more anterior peri-cerebral aqueduct area before finally forming an adult-like pattern comprising five neuronal clusters, E1, E2, E3, E4, and E5, at the postnatal stage. This distribution of histaminergic neuronal clusters in the rat hypothalamus appears to be a consequence of neuronal development and reflects the functional differentiation within each neuronal cluster. However, the close linkage between the locations of histaminergic neuronal clusters and their physiological functions has yet to be fully elucidated because of the sparse information regarding the location and orientation of each histaminergic neuronal clusters in the hypothalamus of rats and mice.

One aspect relevant to the study of the neurofunctional features of biological rhythmicity is the identification of communication pathways between the SCN and other brain areas. As a result, SCN efferent projections have been investigated in several species, including rodents and a few primates. The fibers originating from the two main intrinsic fiber subpopulations, one producing vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and the other producing arginine vasopressin (AVP), exhibit morphological traits that distinguish them from fibers that originate from other brain areas. This distinction provides a parameter to study SCN efferent projections.

The laterodorsal thalamic nucleus (LD) is often treated as a part of the anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN) because of its location and similar connectivity. Our previous studies have shown that distribution of three calcium-binding proteins, i.e. calbindin D28k (CB), calretinin (CR) and parvalbumin (PV), changes within the ATN during development of the guinea pig.

In summary, all the studied calcium-binding proteins were already present in the LD at prenatal developmental stages and the pattern of distribution remained virtually constant until adulthood. Thus, the LD differs considerably from the ATN in an aspect of neurochemical cell differentiation.",

Striatal interneurons display a morphological and chemical heterogeneity that has been particularly well characterized in rats, monkeys and humans. By comparison much less is known of striatal interneurons in mice, although these animals are now widely used as transgenic models of various neurodegenerative diseases. The present immunohistochemical study aimed at characterizing striatal interneurons expressing calretinin (CR) in mice compared to those in squirrel monkeys and humans. The mouse striatum contains both small (912m) and medium-sized (1520m) CR+ cells. The small cells are intensely stained with a single, slightly varicose and moderately arborized process. They occur throughout the striatum (779cells/mm3), but prevail in the area of the subventricular zone and subcallosal streak, with statistically significant anteroposterior and dorsoventral decreasing gradients. The medium-sized cells are less intensely immunoreactive and possess 23 long, slightly varicose and poorly branched dendrites. They are rather uniformly scattered throughout the striatum and three times more numerous (22431cells/mm3) than the smaller CR+ cells. Double immunostaining experiments with choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) as a cholinergic marker in normal and Drd1a-tdTomato/Drd2-EGFP double transgenic mice reveal that none of the small or medium-sized CR+ cells express ChAT or D1 and D2 dopamine receptors. In contrast, the striatum in human and nonhuman primates harbors small and medium-sized CR+/ChAT cells, as well as large CR+/ChAT+ interneurons that are absent in mice. Such a difference between rodents and primates must be taken into consideration if one hopes to better understand the striatal function in normal and pathological conditions.",

Leptin is produced mainly in the white adipose tissue and emerged as one of the key catabolic regulators of food intake and energy expenditure. During the course of aging characteristic alterations in body weight and body composition in humans and mammals, i.e. middle-aged obesity and aging anorexia and cachexia, suggest age-related regulatory changes in energy balance in the background. Aging has been associated with increased fat mass, central and peripheral leptin resistance as indicated by its failure to reduce food intake, to increase metabolic rate and thereby to induce weight loss. Leptin resistance is a common feature of aging and obesity (even in the young). The question arises whether aging or fat accumulation plays the primary role in the development of this resistance. The review focuses mainly on mechanisms and development of central leptin resistance. Age-related decline primarily affects the hypermetabolic component of central catabolic leptin actions, while the anorexigenic component is even growing stronger in the late phase of aging. Obesity enhances resistance to leptin at any age, particularly in old rats, calorie-restriction, on the other hand, increases responsiveness to leptin, especially in the oldest age-group. Thus, without obesity, leptin sensitivity appears not to decrease but to increase by old age. Interactions with other substances (e.g. insulin, cholecystokinin, endogenous cannabinoids) and life-style factors (e.g. exercise) in these age-related changes need to be investigated.",

Teleostean leptin was first cloned in 2005, more than a decade after the discovery of mammalian leptin. The reason for this delay lies in the very poor primary sequence conservation (1325%) between mammalian and fish leptins. These low sequence conservations indicate a high degree of molecular evolvability and warrant a search for different and original functions of leptin in teleosts. Indeed, new and original insights are obtained because of the unique phylogenetic position of teleostean fish as the earliest vertebrates and because of their ectothermy, which means that teleosts are more flexible in changing their metabolism than mammals and leptin could play a role in this flexibility. Research during the last decade reveals that leptin is a truly pleiotropic hormone in fish and mammals alike, with functions among others in the regulation of food intake and body weight, development, but also in the regulation of the stress axis and acclimation processes to for instance low oxygen levels in the water. In this review, we provide an overview of the teleostean leptin work done in the last ten years, and demonstrate that the power of a comparative approach leads to new insights on the origins of leptin physiology.",

Volatile and non-volatile derivates of gonadal steroids are known to act as pheromones in many mammalian species. Pheromones have multiple effects on the brain via the olfactory system. Their primary port of entry seems to be the vomeronasal organ (VNO) but the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms are unclear so far. Recently we localized sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) in both the main and the accessory olfactory system of rat with immunocytochemistry and RT-PCR. The accessory olfactory system consisting of VNO and accessory olfactory bulb showed high expression of SHBG.In the present paper we studied SHBG expression in the VNO in greater detail. In semithin sections we found SHBG immunostaining in the perinuclear cytoplasm of some of the sensory neurons, in sensory cilia and in their axons. A portion of the basal cells and some of the goblet cells in the non-sensory epithelium showed intense SHBG staining. SHBG was abundant in exocrine cells of the vomeronasal glands, perhaps compartimentalized in secretory vesicles. In situ hybridization revealed specific signals in sensory and non-sensory cells of the VNO. Our findings indicate that SHBG expressed in the VNO may be liberated into nasal secretions to bind aerosolic steroids. SHBG in sensory cells may be involved in signaling actions of pheromones.",

The enzyme 5-reductase catalyzes the transformation of progesterone, testosterone, and deoxycorticosterone into 5-reduced metabolites, which are recognized as neurosteroids in the brain with variable potential neuroactivity. Two isoforms of 5-reductase were identified in rodents, and, of these, 5-reductase type 1 (5-R1) is abundantly expressed in the brain. To understand the multiple influences of neurosteroids in the central nervous system, we need to know their region-specific synthesis. The present study reports the detailed localization of 5-R1 in the adult rat cerebellum. The occurrence of 5-R1 was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The enzyme activity was also detected by thin layer chromatography. Immunocytochemistry showed 5-R1 immunoreactive cells in all cerebellar layers. Multiple immunolabeling revealed that 5-R1 was mainly localized in glia, such as astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. The most intense immunoreactivity for 5-R1 was found in Bergmann glia, and the processes of these glia were associated with dendrites of both Purkinje cells and interneurons in the molecular layer. The 5-R1 in the cerebellum was expressed consistently throughout different ages and sexes, in both gonadectomized and hypophysectomized rats.

This study investigated the nuclear organization of four immunohistochemically identifiable neural systems (cholinergic, catecholaminergic, serotonergic and orexinergic) within the brains of three male Tasmanian devils (Sarcophilus harrisii), which had a mean brain mass of 11.6g. We found that the nuclei generally observed for these systems in other mammalian brains were present in the brain of the Tasmanian devil. Despite this, specific differences in the nuclear organization of the cholinergic, catecholaminergic and serotonergic systems appear to carry a phylogenetic signal. In the cholinergic system, only the dorsal hypothalamic cholinergic nucleus could be observed, while an extra dorsal subdivision of the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus and cholinergic neurons within the gelatinous layer of the caudal spinal trigeminal nucleus were observed. Within the catecholaminergic system the A4 nucleus of the locus coeruleus complex was absent, as was the caudal ventrolateral serotonergic group of the serotonergic system. The organization of the orexinergic system was similar to that seen in many mammals previously studied. Overall, while showing strong similarities to the organization of these systems in other mammals, the specific differences observed in the Tasmanian devil reveal either order specific, or class specific, features of these systems. Further studies will reveal the extent of change in the nuclear organization of these systems in marsupials and how these potential changes may affect functionality.",

As -aminobutyric acid (GABA) is synthesized by two isoforms of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), namely, GAD65 and GAD67, immunohistochemically targeting either isoform of GAD is theoretically useful for identifying GABAergic cell bodies. In practice, targeting GAD67 remains to be a popular choice. However, identifying GABAergic cell bodies with GAD67 immunoreactivity in the hippocampal dentate gyrus, especially in the hilus, is not without pitfalls. In the present study, we compared the characteristics of GAD65 immunoreactivity to GAD67 immunoreactivity in the rat dentate gyrus and examined perikaryal expression of GAD65 in four neurochemically prevalent subgroups of interneurons in the hilus.Experiments were done in normal adult Sprague-Dawley rats and GAD67-GFP knock-in mice. Horizontal hippocampal slices cut from the ventral portion of hippocampi were immunofluorescently stained and scanned using a confocal microscope. Immunoreactivity for both GAD67 and GAD65 was visible throughout the dentate gyrus. Perikaryal GAD67 immunoreactivity was denser but variable in terms of distribution pattern and intensity among cells whereas perikaryal GAD65 immunoreactivity displayed similar distribution pattern and staining intensity. Among different layers of the dentate gyrus, GAD67 immunoreactivity was densest in the hilus despite GAD65 immunoreactivity being more intense in the granule cell layer. Co-localization experiments showed that GAD65, but not GAD67, was expressed in all hilar calretinin (CR)-, neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS)-, parvalbumin (PV)- or somatostatin (SOM)-positive somata. Labeling CR, nNOS, PV, and SOM in sections obtained from GAD67-GFP knock-in mice revealed that a large portion of SOM-positive cells had weak GFP expression. In addition, double labeling of GAD65/GABA and GAD67/GABA showed that nearly all of GABA-immunoreactive cells had perikaryal GAD65 expression whereas more than one-tenth of GABA-immunoreactive cells lacked perikaryal GAD67 immunoreactivity. Inhibition of axonal transport with colchicine dramatically improved perikaryal GAD65 immunoreactivity in GABAergic cells without significant augmentation to be seen in granule cells. Double labeling GAD65 and GAD67 in the sections obtained from colchicine-pretreated animals confirmed that a portion of GAD65-immunoreactive cells had weak or even no GAD67 immunoreactivity.We conclude that for confocal imaging, immunofluorescently labeling GAD65 for identifying GABAergic somata in the hilus of the dentate gyrus has advantages over labeling GAD67 in terms of easier recognition of perikaryal labeling and more consistent expression in GABAergic somata. Inhibition of axonal transport with colchicine further improves perikaryal GAD65 labeling, making GABAergic cells more distinguishable.",

Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurological disease with motor, cognitive and psychiatric symptoms. Characterised by neuronal degeneration, HD pathology is initially apparent in the striatum and cortex. Considerable research has recently suggested that the neurological immune response apparent in brain injury and disease may provide a valuable therapeutic target. Cannabinoid CB2 receptors are localised and up-regulated on a number of peripheral immune cell types following inflammation and injury. However, their cellular location within the human brain during inflammation has not been well characterised.The present study shows CB2 is expressed in human post-mortem striatum in HD. Quantification revealed a trend towards an increase in CB2 staining with disease, but no significant difference was measured compared to neurologically normal controls. In HD striatal tissue, there is an up-regulation of the brains' resident immune cells, with a significant increase in GFAP-positive astrocyte staining at both grade 1 (685118%) and grade 3 (1145163%) and Iba1-positive microglia at grade 1 (29927%) but not grade 3 (11948%), compared to neurologically normal controls. Both cell types exhibit irregular cell morphology, particularly at higher grades.Using double-labelled immunohistochemistry CB2 receptors are demonstrated not to be expressed on microglia or astrocytes and instead appear to be localised on CD31-positive blood vessel endothelium and vascular smooth muscle. Co-expression analysis suggests that CB2 may be more highly expressed on CD31 positive cells in HD brains than in control brains.

Pilocarpine model for temporal lobe epilepsy has shown aberrant neurogenesis, but mainly restricted to the dentate gyrus (DG). Herein, by using a modified protocol, combining pilocarpine with ipratropium bromide, we unexpectedly observed a heretofore-unrecognized distinct cellular population expressing the neuroprogenitor marker doublecortin (DCX) on post insult days (PID) 10, 14 and 18, mainly located in the temporal segment of the hippocampal fissure (hf).

Massive increase of BrdU labeling was found in the delayed group and the neural stem cell-specific marker nestin was highly expressed in the same narrow band on PID7, so was glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP).

From low to moderate CART immunoreactivity was observed in all divisions of the MGB, although in most of its length only fibers and neuropil were labeled. A small number of CART immunoreactive somata were observed in the caudal segment of the MGB. The central parts of all divisions contained a distinctly smaller number of CART immunoreactive fibers relative to their outer borders, where CART fibers formed patchy clusters. As a whole, the intense CART immunoreactive borders formed a shell around the weakly CART labeled core. Double-labeling immunofluorescence showed that CART did not colocalize with either calbindin, calretinin or parvalbumin, whose immunoreactivity was predominantly restricted to perikarya. The distribution pattern of calretinin was more similar to that of calbindin than to that of parvalbumin. Calretinin and calbindin exhibited higher immunoreactivity in the medial and dorsal divisions of the MGB, where parvalbumin staining was low. In general, although parvalbumin exhibited the weakest immunoreactivity of all studied Ca2+ binding proteins, it was most highly expressed in the ventral division of the MGB.

The claustrum is a telencephalic nucleus located ventrolateral to the basal ganglia in the mammalian brain. It has an extensive reciprocal connectivity with most if not all of the cerebral cortex, in particular, primary sensory areas. However, despite renewed and growing interest amongst investigators, there remains a paucity of data concerning its peptidergic profile. The aim of the present study was to examine the presence, morphology, distribution and ultrastructure of neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive (NPY-ir) neurons and fibers in the claustrum of the cat. Ten adult healthy cats from both sexes were used. All animals received human and ethical treatment in accordance with the Principles of Laboratory Animal Care. Subjects were irreversibly anesthetized and transcardially perfused with fixative solution containing glutaraldehyde and paraformaldehyde. Brains were promptly removed, postfixed and sectioned. Slices were incubated with polyclonal anti-NPY antibodies according to the standard avidinbiotinperoxidase complex method adopted by our Department of Anatomy, Histology and Embryology. NPY-ir neurons and fibers were found to be diffusely distributed throughout the claustrum, with no obvious topographic or functional patterning other than larger numbers in its central/broadest part (stereotaxic planes A12A16). Neurons were generally classified by diameter into three sizes: small (under 17m), medium (1725m) and large (over 25m). Staining density is varied with some neurons appearing darker than others. At the electron-microscopic level NPY immunoproduct was observed within neurons, dendrites and terminal boutons, each differing relative to their ultrastructural attributes. Two types of NPY-ir synaptic boutons were found. Lastly, it is of interest to note that gender-specific differences were not observed.",

Previous investigations of the anatomical basis of the neuropathic-like manifestations in the spinal nerve ligation animal model have shown that the central terminations of the unmyelinated primary afferents of L5 spinal nerve are not restricted to the corresponding L5 spinal segment, and rather extend to two spinal segments rostrally and one segment caudally where they intermingle with primary afferents of the adjacent L4 spinal nerve. The aim of the present study was to investigate the neurochemical changes in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and DRGs after L5 nerve injury in rats. In the first experiment, the right L5 nerve was ligated and sectioned for 14 days, and isolectin B4 (IB4, a tracer for unmyelinated primary afferents) was injected into the left L5 nerve. The results showed that the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) was up-regulated in laminae III of L3L6 spinal segments on the right side in exactly the same areas where IB4 labelled terminals were revealed on the left side. In the second experiment, L5 was ligated and sectioned and the spinal cord and DRGs were stained immunocytochemically with antibodies raised against various peptides known to be involved in pain transmission and hyperalgesia. The results showed that L5 nerve lesion caused down-regulation of substance P, calcitonin-gene related peptide and IB4 binding and up-regulation of neuropeptide Y and neurokinin-1 receptor in the dorsal horn of L4 and L5 spinal segments. Similar neurochemical changes were observed only in the corresponding L5 DRG with minimal effects observed in L3, L4 and L6 DRGs. Although, L5 nerve injury caused an up-regulation in NPY, no change in SP and CGRP immunoreactivity was observed in ipsilateral garcile nucleus. These neuroplastic changes in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, in the adjacent uninjured territories of the central terminations of the adjacent uninjured nerves, might explain the mechanism of hyperalgesia after peripheral nerve injury.",

We examined the substrates for ocular nociception in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Capsaicin application to the ocular surface in awake rats evoked nocifensive responses and suppressed spontaneous grooming responses. Thus, peripheral capsaicin was able to activate the central pathways encoding ocular nociception. Our capsaicin stimulus evoked c-Fos expression in a select population of neurons within rostral trigeminal nucleus caudalis in anesthetized rats. These activated neurons also received direct contacts from corneal afferent fibers traced with cholera toxin B from the corneal surface. However, the central terminals of the corneal afferents that contacted capsaicin-activated trigeminal neurons did not contain TRPV1. To determine if TRPV1 expression had been altered by capsaicin stimulation, we examined TRPV1 content of corneal afferents in animals that did not receive capsaicin stimulation. These studies confirmed that while TRPV1 was present in 30% of CTb-labeled corneal afferent neurons within the trigeminal ganglion, TRPV1 was only detected in 2% of the central terminals of these corneal afferents within the trigeminal nucleus caudalis. Other TRP channels were also present in low proportions of central corneal afferent terminals in unstimulated animals (TRPM8, 2%; TRPA1, 10%). These findings indicate that a pathway from the cornea to rostral trigeminal nucleus caudalis is involved in corneal nociceptive transmission, but that central TRP channel expression is unrelated to the type of stimulus transduced by the peripheral nociceptive endings.",

Extracellular acidification activates a family of proteins known as acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs). One ASIC subtype, ASIC type 1 (ASIC1), may play an important role in synaptic plasticity, memory, fear conditioning and ischemic brain injury. ASIC1 is found primarily in neurons, but one report showed its expression in isolated mouse cerebrovascular cells. In this study, we sought to determine if ASIC1 is present in intact rat and human major cerebral arteries. A potential physiological significance of such a finding is suggested by studies showing that nitric oxide (NO), which acts as a powerful vasodilator, may modulate proton-gated currents in cultured cells expressing ASIC1s. Because both constitutive NO synthesizing enzymes, neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and endothelial NOS (eNOS), are expressed in cerebral arteries we also studied the anatomical relationship between ASIC1 and nNOS or eNOS in both rat and human cerebral arteries. Western blot analysis demonstrated ASIC1 in cerebral arteries from both species. Immunofluorescent histochemistry and confocal microscopy also showed that ASIC1-immunoreactivity (IR), colocalized with the smooth muscle marker alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA), was present in the anterior cerebral artery (ACA), middle cerebral artery (MCA), posterior cerebral artery (PCA) and basilar artery (BA) of rat and human. Expression of ASIC1 in cerebral arteries is consistent with a role for ASIC1 in modulating cerebrovascular tone both in rat and human. Potential interactions between smooth muscle ASIC1 and nNOS or eNOS were supported by the presence of nNOS-IR in the neighboring adventitial layer and the presence of nNOS-IR and eNOS-IR in the adjacent endothelial layer of the cerebral arteries.",

ObjectiveEarlier studies suggest that high-calorie diet is an important risk factor for neuronal damage resulting from oxidative stress of lipid metabolism. In our experimental study of rats under high-fat diet, oxidative stress markers and axonal degeneration parameters were used to observe the sciatic nerve neuropathy. The aim of this study is to evaluate the pathophysiology of neuropathy induced by high-fat diet. MethodsA total of 14 male rats (Wistar albino) were randomly divided into two experimental groups as follows; control group (n=7) and the model group (n=7); while control group was fed with standard diet; where the model group was fed with a high-fat diet for 12 weeks. At the end of 12 weeks, the lipid profile and blood glucose levels, interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), and transforming growth factor- (TGF-) levels were studied. Tissue malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO) levels and super-oxide dismutase (SOD), paraoxonase-1 (PON-1) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities were studied. The distal blocks of the left sciatic nerves were evaluated for histomorphological analysis (including mean axon area, axon numbers, nerve fiber diameters, axon diameters, and thickness of myelin sheets). ResultsBody weights, serum glucose and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels of rats were found not statistically significantly different compared between the model and the control groups (p>0.05). Serum cholesterol, triglyceride, TGF- and TNF- levels were significantly higher in the model group when compared with the control group (p<0.05). IL-1 and IL-6 levels were not statistically significantly different compared between the model group and the control group (p>0.05). The MDA and NO levels and the SOD and GPx activities of the sciatic nerves in model group were statistically significantly higher than the control group (p<0.05). In addition, the activities of PON-1 were statistically significantly lower in the model group when compared with the control group (p<0.05). The difference in the total number of myelinated axons between the control group and the model group was not statistically significant (p>0.05). The nerve fiber diameter and the thickness of the myelin sheet were statistically significantly lower in the model group when compared with the control group (p<0.05). The axon diameter and area were significantly decreased in the model group when compared with the control group (p<0.05).

Nuclei strongly labeled for ARNT2 were observed in the SN reticulata, while only weak immunoreactivity for ARNT2 was found in TH-immunoreactive neurons in SN compacta and VTA. Stereological analysis showed that ARNT was preferentially expressed in dopaminergic neurons in SN compacta and VTA.

The adipocyte-derived hormone leptin plays a critical role as a metabolic cue for the reproductive system. Conditions of low leptin levels observed in negative energy balance and loss-of-function mutations of leptin or leptin receptor genes are characterized by decreased fertility. In recent years, advances have been made for identifying possible hypothalamic neurons relaying leptins neuroendocrine control of reproductive function. Studies from different laboratories have demonstrated that leptin action in the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis is exerted via hypothalamic interneurons regulating gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) cells, oppose to direct action on GnRH neurons. Following this observation, studies focused on identifying leptin responsive interneurons.

Endogenous re-expression of LepRb however, in glutamatergic neurons of the ventral premammilary nucleus (PMV) or ablation of agouti-related protein (AgRP) neurons from leptin signaling-deficient mice are both sufficient to induce puberty and improve fertility.

Fractones are extracellular matrix structures that display a fractal ultrastructure and that are visualized as puncta after immunolabeling for laminin or heparan sulfate proteoglycans. In the adult brain, fractones are found throughout the subventricular zone (SVZ). The role of fractones is just emerging. We have recently shown that fractones sequester fibroblast growth factor-2 and bone morphogenetic protein-7 from the brain ventricles to regulate cell proliferation in the SVZ of the lateral ventricle, the primary neural stem cell niche and neurogenic zone in adulthood. Here, we have examined in vivo the effect of bone morphogenetic protein-4 (BMP-4) on cell proliferation in the SVZ and we have determined whether BMP-4 interacts with fractones to promote this effect. To examine BMP-4 effect on cell proliferation, BMP-4 was intracerebroventricularly injected, and bromodeoxyuridine immunolabeling was performed on frozen sections of the adult mouse brain. To identify the location of BMP-4 binding, biotinylated-BMP-4 was injected, and its binding localized post-mortem with streptavidin, Texas red conjugate. Injection of heparitinase-1 was used to desulfate fractones and determine whether the binding and the effect of BMP-4 on cell proliferation are heparan sulfate-dependent. BMP-4 inhibited cell proliferation in the SVZ neurogenic zone. Biotinylated-BMP-4 bound to fractones and some adjacent blood vessels. Co-injection of heparitinase-1 and biotinylated-BMP-4 resulted in the absence of signal for biotinylated-BMP-4, indicating that the binding was heparan sulfate dependent. Moreover, preventing the binding of BMP-4 to fractones by heparitinase-1 reinforced the inhibitory effect of BMP-4 on cell proliferation in the SVZ. These results show that BMP-4 inhibits cell proliferation in the SVZ neurogenic zone and that the binding of BMP-4 to fractone-associated heparan sulfates moderates this inhibitory effect. Together with our previous results, these data support the view that fractones capture growth factors and modulate their activity in the neural tissues lining the ventricles.",

Leptin has long been associated with metabolism as it is a critical regulator of both food intake and energy expenditure, but recently, leptin dysregulation has been proposed as a mechanism of psychopathology. This review discusses the evidence supporting a role for leptin in mental health disorders and describes potential mechanisms that may underlie this association. Leptin plays a critical role in pregnancy and in fetal growth and development. Leptin's role and profile during development is examined in available human studies, and the validity of applying studies conducted in animal models to the human population are discussed. Rodents experience a postnatal leptin surge, which does not occur in humans or larger animal models. This suggests that further research using large mammal models, which have a leptin profile across pregnancy and development similar to humans, are of high importance. Maternal obesity and hyperleptinemia correlate with increased leptin levels in the umbilical cord, placenta, and fetus. Leptin levels are thought to impact fetal brain development; likely by activating proinflammatory cytokines that are known to impact many of the neurotransmitter systems that regulate behavior. Leptin is likely involved in behavioral regulation as leptin receptors are widely distributed in the brain, and leptin influences cortisol release, the mesoaccumbens dopamine pathway, serotonin synthesis, and hippocampal synaptic plasticity. In humans, both high and low levels of leptin are reported to be associated with psychopathology. This inconsistency is likely due to differences in the metabolic state of the study populations. Leptin resistance, which occurs in the obese state, may explain how both high and low levels of leptin are associated with psychopathology, as well as the comorbidity of obesity with numerous mental illnesses. Leptin resistance is likely to influence disorders such as depression and anxiety where high leptin levels have been correlated with symptomatology. Schizophrenia is also associated with both low and high leptin levels. However, as anti-psychotics pharmacotherapy induces weight gain, which elevates leptin levels, drug-naive populations are needed for further studies. Elevated circulating leptin is consistently found in childhood neurodevelopmental disorders including autism spectrum disorders and Rhett disorder. Further, studies on the impact of leptin and leptin resistance on psychopathology and neurodevelopmental disorders are important directions for future research. Studies examining the mechanisms by which exposure to maternal obesity and hyperleptinemia during fetal development impact brain development and behavior are critical for the health of future generations.",

Changes in calciumcalmodulin protein kinase II (CaMKII) have been well demonstrated in nervous tissue of diabetic animal models. Skin shares the same ectodermal origin as nervous tissue and it is often affected in diabetic patients. The goal of this study was to analyze expression of CaMKII in rat foot pad 2 weeks and 2 months after induction of diabetes type 1 and 2.Forty-two Sprague-Dawley rats were used. Diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1) was induced with intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected 55mg/kg of streptozotocin (STZ) and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) with a combination of high-fat diet (HFD) and i.p. injection of low-dose STZ (35mg/kg). Two weeks and two months following diabetes induction rats were sacrificed and skin samples from plantar surface of the both hind paws were removed. Immunohistochemistry was performed for detection of total CaMKII (tCaMKII) and its alpha isoform (pCaMKII). For detection of intraepidermal nerve fibers polyclonal antiserum against protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5) was used.The results showed that CaMKII was expressed in the skin of both diabetic models. Total CaMKII was uniformly distributed throughout the epidermis and pCaMKII was limited to stratum granulosum. The tCaMKII and pCaMKII were not expressed in intraepidermal nerve fibers. Two weeks after induction of diabetes in rats there were no significant differences in expression of tCaMKII and pCaMKII between DM1 and DM2 compared to respective controls. In the 2-month experiments, significant increase in epidermal expression of tCaMKII and pCaMKII was observed in DM1 animals compared to controls, but not in DM2 animals.This study is the first description of cutaneous CaMKII expression pattern in a diabetic model. CaMKII could play a role in transformation of skin layers and contribute to cutaneous diabetic changes. Further research on physiological role of CaMKII in skin and its role in cutaneous diabetic complications should be undertaken in order to elucidate its function in epidermis.",

Research indicates that responses to stress are sexually dimorphic, particularly in regard to learning and memory processes: while males display impaired cognitive performance and hippocampal CA3 pyramidal cell dendritic remodeling following chronic stress, females exhibit enhanced performance and no remodeling. Leu-enkephalin, an endogenous opioid peptide found in the hippocampal mossy fiber pathway, plays a critical role in mediating synaptic plasticity at the mossy fiber-CA3 pyramidal cell synapse. Estrogen is known to influence the expression of leu-enkephalin in the mossy fibers of females, with leu-enkephalin levels being highest at proestrus and estrus, when estrogen levels are elevated. Since stress is also known to alter the expression of leu-enkephalin in various brain regions, this study was designed to determine whether acute or chronic stress had an effect on mossy fiber leu-enkephalin levels in females or males, through the application of correlated quantitative light and electron microscopic immunocytochemistry. Both acute and chronic stress eliminated the estrogen-dependence of leu-enkephalin levels across the estrous cycle in females, but had no effect on male levels. However, following acute stress leu-enkephalin levels in females were consistently lowered to values comparable to the lowest control values, while following chronic stress they were consistently elevated to values comparable to the highest control values. Ultrastructural changes in leu-enkephalin labeled dense core vesicles paralleled light microscopic observations, with acute stress inducing a decrease in leu-enkephalin labeled dense core vesicles, and chronic stress inducing an increase in leu-enkephalin labeled dense-core vesicles in females. These findings suggest that alterations in leu-enkephalin levels following stress could play an important role in the sex-specific responses that females display in learning processes, including those important in addiction.",

Despite a plethora of studies on this enzyme, knowledge about the regional and cellular distribution of this enzyme in human brain is still fragmentary. Therefore, we mapped fourteen post-mortem brains of psychically healthy individuals for the distribution of the glutamine synthetase immunoreactive protein. It was found that glutamine synthetase immunoreactivity is expressed in multiple gray and white matter astrocytes, but also in oligodendrocytes, ependymal cells and certain neurons. Since a possible extra-astrocytic expression of glutamine synthetase is highly controversial, we paid special attention to its appearance in oligodendrocytes and neurons. By double immunolabeling of mouse brain slices and cultured mouse brain cells for glutamine synthetase and cell-type-specific markers we provide evidence that besides astrocytes subpopulations of oligodendrocytes, microglial cells and neurons express glutamine synthetase. Moreover, we show that glutamine synthetase-immunopositive neurons are not randomly distributed throughout human and mouse brain, but represent a subpopulation of nitrergic (i.e. neuronal nitric oxide synthase expressing) neurons. Possible functional implications of an extra-astrocytic localization of glutamine synthetase are discussed.",

In the last 20 years there have been many studies investigating the distribution of 5-HT4-receptors in the brain of different species. Most studies are methodically based on RT-PCR or in situ hybridization and have analysed the receptors at the mRNA level.Furthermore there have been some autoradiographic studies using specific 5-HT4-receptor antagonists like [3H]GR113808, [3H]BIMU-1 or [125I]SB207710.This study investigates the topographical distribution of the 5-HT4(a)-receptor in the juvenile rat brain and spinal cord, which is important for neuromodulation of cellular excitability and could be involved in various developmental processes of the central nervous system. We analysed the 5-HT4(a)-receptor at protein level with a monospecific polyclonal antibody by using an immunohistochemical staining.We saw an intensive staining in some areas of the cortex, in the olfactory bulb, in most areas of the cerebellum, in hippocampal areas like the dentate gyrus and in several different areas of the brainstem, especially in the motor nuclei. Overall we have shown comparable results in accordance with the results of other studies investigating the distribution of 5-HT4(a)-receptors.Some areas like the islands of Calleja, the preoptic nucleus or the medial habenular nucleus showed a lower intensity of 5-HT4(a)-receptors in comparison with the results of other studies. As a novel result we found a higher intensity of 5-HT4(a)-receptor in several brain areas associated with motor function than was shown by other studies, especially in the motor cortex, in different areas of the cerebellum, in the red nucleus, in the motor nuclei of the brainstem or in the ventral horn cells of the spinal cord.We conclude that the 5-HT4(a)-receptor may play a more prominent role in the modulation of motor cortico-ponto-cerebellar, cortico-spinal, rubro-spinal, vestibulo-spinal and cortico-nuclear tracts during juvenile development.",

Our present study evaluates the effect of 3-month chronic nicotine treatment on the levels of multiple quaternary ammonium compounds as well as glutamate and gamma aminobutyric acid in the rat prefrontal cortex, dorsal striatum and hypothalamus. We observed a marked decrease of acetylcholine levels in the dorsal striatum (22.88%, p<0.01), reflecting the impact of chronic nicotine in local interneuron circuits.

Finally, we identified an increase of prefrontal cortex glutamate levels (8.05%, p<0.05), supporting previous studies suggesting enhanced prefrontal activity during chronic drug use. Our study shows that quaternary ammonium compounds are regulated in a highly brain region specific manner during chronic nicotine treatment, and provides novel insights into neurochemical regulation during nicotine use.",

BrdU was used to quantify cellular proliferation in the adult canary brain.Extensive cellular proliferation is present in the lateral ventricle wall of canaries.Proliferation is more intense in the ventral than in the dorsal ventricular zone.Proliferation appears more active in females than males at rostral levels.Testosterone increase proliferation at all levels caudal to the anterior commissure. Previous work in songbirds has suggested that testosterone increases neuronal recruitment and survival in HVC but does not affect neuronal proliferation in the ventricular zone and that males and females have similar rates of proliferation except at discrete locations. Many of these conclusions are however based on limited data or were inferred indirectly. Here we specifically tested the effects of testosterone on cellular proliferation in the ventricular zone of both male and female adult canaries. We implanted adult birds of both sexes with testosterone or empty implants for 1 week and injected them with BrdU. One day later, we collected their brains and quantified BrdU-positive cells in the ventricular zone (VZ) at different rostro-caudal levels of the brain, ranging from the level where the song nucleus Area X occurs through the caudal extent of HVC. Proliferation in the dorsal part of the VZ was low and unaffected by sex or testosterone treatment. In the ventral part of the VZ, females had more proliferating cells than males, but only at rostral levels, near Area X. Also in the ventral part of the VZ, testosterone increased proliferation in birds of both sexes, but only in the mid- to caudal-VZ, caudal to the level of Area X, around the septum and HVC. We thus demonstrate here that there is both an effect of testosterone and possibly a more subtle effect of sex on cellular proliferation in the adult songbird brain, and that these effects are specific to different levels of the brain.",

As one of the main serotonergic (5HT) projections to the forebrain, the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) has been implicated in disorders of anxiety and depression. Although the nucleus contains the densest population of 5HT neurons in the brain, at least 50% of cells within this structure are non-serotonergic, including a large population of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) containing neurons. The DRN has a unique topographical efferent organization and can also be divided into sub-regions based on rostro-caudal and medio-lateral dimensions. NOS is co-localized with 5HT in the midline DRN but NOS-positive cells in the lateral wing (LW) of the nucleus do not express 5HT. Interestingly, the NOS LW neuronal population is immediately rostral to and in line with the cholinergic lateral dorsal tegmental nucleus (LDT). We used immunohistochemical methods to investigate the potential serotonergic regulation of NOS LW neurons and also the association of this cell grouping to the LDT. Our results indicate that >75% of NOS LW neurons express the inhibitory 5HT1A receptor and are cholinergic (>90%). The findings suggest this assembly of cells is a rostral extension of the LDT, one that it is subject to regulation by 5HT release.

Vocal communication has emerged as a powerful model for the study of neural mechanisms of social behavior. Modulatory neurochemicals postulated to play a central role in social behavior, related to motivation, arousal, incentive and reward, include the catecholamines, particularly dopamine and noradrenaline. Many questions remain regarding the functional mechanisms by which these modulators interact with sensory and motor systems. Here, we begin to address these questions in a model system for vocal and social behavior, the plainfin midshipman fish (Porichthys notatus). We mapped the distribution of immunoreactivity for the catecholamine-synthesizing enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the midshipman brain. The general pattern of TH+ cell groups in midshipman appears to be highly conserved with other teleost fish, with a few exceptions, including the apparent absence of pretectal catecholamine cells. Many components of the midshipman vocal and auditory systems were innervated by TH+ fibers and terminals, including portions of the subpallial area ventralis, the preoptic complex, and the anterior hypothalamus, the midbrain periaqueductal gray and torus semicircularis, several hindbrain auditory nuclei, and parts of the hindbrain vocal pattern generator. These areas thus represent potential sites for catecholamine modulation of vocal and/or auditory behavior. To begin to test functionally whether catecholamines modulate vocal social behaviors, we hypothesized that male and female midshipman, which are sexually dimorphic in both their vocal-motor repertoires and in their responses to hearing conspecific vocalizations, should exhibit sexually dimorphic expression of TH immunoreactivity in their vocal and/or auditory systems. We used quantitative immunohistochemical techniques to test this hypothesis across a number of brain areas. We found significantly higher levels of TH expression in male midshipman relative to females in the TH cell population in the paraventricular organ of the diencephalon and in the TH-innervated torus semicircularis, the main teleost midbrain auditory structure. The torus semicircularis has been implicated in sexually dimorphic behavioral responses to conspecific vocalizations. Our data thus support the general idea that catecholamines modulate vocal and auditory processing in midshipman, and the specific hypothesis that they shape sexually dimorphic auditory responses in the auditory midbrain.",

The anorexigenic hormone leptin plays an important role in the control of food intake and feeding-related behavior, for an important part through its action in the hypothalamus. The adipose-derived hormone modulates a complex network of several intercommunicating orexigenic and anorexigenic neuropeptides in the hypothalamus to reduce food intake and increase energy expenditure. In this review we present an updated overview of the functional role of leptin in respect to feeding and feeding-related behavior per distinct hypothalamic nuclei. In addition to the arcuate nucleus, which is a major leptin sensitive hub, leptin-responsive neurons in other hypothalamic nuclei, including the, dorsomedial-, ventromedial- and paraventricular nucleus and the lateral hypothalamic area, are direct targets of leptin. However, leptin also modulates hypothalamic neurons in an indirect manner, such as via the melanocortin system. The dissection of the complexity of leptin's action on the networks involved in energy balance is subject of recent and future studies. A full understanding of the role of hypothalamic leptin in the regulation of energy balance requires cell-specific manipulation using of conditional deletion and expression of leptin receptors. In addition, optogenetic and pharmacogenetic tools in combination with other pharmacological (such as the recent discovery of a leptin receptor antagonist) and neuronal tracing techniques to map the circuit, will be helpful to understand the role of leptin receptor expressing neurons. Better understanding of these circuits and the involvement of leptin could provide potential sites for therapeutic interventions in obesity and metabolic diseases characterized by dysregulation of energy balance.",

Compared to type II, type I microglia were significantly smaller, thinner, more tortuous and ramified, and less complex (lower fractal dimensions). PAL performance was both linearly and non-linearly correlated with type I microglial morphological features from the rostral and caudal DG-Mol, but not with microglia from the CA1-LMol. These differences in microglial morphology and correlations with PAL performance were consistent with previous proposals of hippocampal regional contributions for spatial learning and memory. Our results suggested that at least two morphological microglial phenotypes provided distinct physiological roles to learning-associated activity in the rostral and caudal DG-Mol of the monkey brain.",

Ovarian steroids are known to act on the olfactory system. Their mode of action, however, is mostly unclear to date since nuclear receptors are lacking in sensory neurons. Here we used immunocytochemistry and RT-PCR to study expression and distribution of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) in the rat olfactory system. Single sensory cells in the olfactory mucosa and their projections in the olfactory bulb showed specific SHBG immunostaining as determined by double immunofluorescence with olfactory marker protein OMP. Larger groups of SHBG stained sensory cells occurred in the vomeronasal organ (VNO). A portion of the olfactory glomeruli in the accessory olfactory bulb showed large networks of SHBG positive nerve fibres. Some of the mitral cells showed SHBG immune fluorescence. RT-PCR revealed SHBG encoding mRNA in the olfactory mucosa, in the VNO and in the olfactory bulbs indicating intrinsic expression of the binding globulin. The VNO and its related projections within the limbic system are known to be sensitive to gonadal steroid hormones. We conclude that SHBG may be of functional importance for rapid effects of olfactory steroids on limbic functions including the control of reproductive behaviours through pheromones.",

The 3-hydroxytyramine/dopamine is a monoamine of the catecholamine group and it is a precursor of the noradrenaline and adrenaline synthesis, in which the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase acts as a rate-limiting enzyme. The dopaminergic nuclei retrorubral field (A8 group), substantia nigra pars compacta (A9 group) and ventral tegmental area (A10 group) are involved in three complex circuitries named mesostriatal, mesocortical and mesolimbic, which are directly related to various behavioral manifestations such as motor control, reward signaling in behavioral learning, motivation and pathological manifestations of Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. The aim of this study was to describe the delimitation of A8, A9 and A10 groups and the morphology of their neurons in the brain of the rock cavy (Kerodon rupestris), a typical Brazilian Northeast rodent belonging to the suborder Hystricomorpha, family Caviidae. Coronal and sagittal sections of the rock cavy brains were submitted to Nissl staining and TH immunohistochemistry. The organization of these dopaminergic nuclei in the rock cavy brain is very similar to that found in other animals of the Rodentia order, except for the presence of the tail of the substantia nigra, which is found only in the species under study.

VGluT3 is localized in non-glutamatergic neurons of the brain and retinal amacrine cells. In birds, the vGluT3 genome is found, but its distribution in the brain or retina is unknown. The present study was conducted to analyze vGluT3 cDNA sequence and elucidate its distribution in the pigeon brain and retina. The vGluT3 cDNA comprises 1761bp and showed 95% and 88% identity to the chicken and zebra finch vGluT3 cDNAs, respectively, and 74% identity to human vGluT3 cDNA.

The present study describes the distribution and levels of 16 amino acids (alanine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glycine, glutamic acid, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, proline, sarcosine, serine, valine, and threonine) in brain tissues (prefrontal cortex, striatum, hippocampus and cerebellum) and the serum. Neurochemical analysis was performed on Wistar rats and C57BL/6 mice using an efficient method for extraction, a fast microwave-assisted derivatization and gas chromatographymass spectrometry analysis. The amino acid concentration varied across brain regions for 14 of the 16 analyzed molecules, with detection limits ranging from 0.020.005molL1 to 7.070.05molL1. In rats, the concentrations of alanine, glycine, methionine, serine and threonine were higher in prefrontal cortex than in other areas, whereas in mice, the concentrations of glutamic acid, leucine and proline were highest in the hippocampus.

Pax6 and Pax7 are transcription factors essential for the development of the CNS. In addition, increasing data, mainly obtained in amniotes, support that they are expressed in subsets of neurons in the adult, likely playing a role in maintaining neuron type identity. In the present study we analyzed the detailed distribution of Pax6 and Pax7 cells in the adult CNS of Xenopus laevis. Immunohistochemistry with antibodies that are required for high-resolution analysis of Pax-expressing cells was conducted. A wide distribution of Pax6 and Pax7 cells throughout the CNS was detected, with distinct patterns that showed only slight overlapping. Only Pax6 was expressed in the telencephalon, including the olfactory bulbs, septum, striatum and amygdaloid complex. In the diencephalon, Pax6 and Pax7 were distinct in the alar and basal parts, respectively, of prosomere 3. Large numbers of Pax6 and Pax7 cells were distributed in the pretectal region (alar plate of prosomere 1) but only Pax6 cells extended into basal plate. Pax7 specifically labeled cells in the optic tectum, including the ventricular zone, and Pax6 cells were the only cells found in the tegmentum. Pax6 was found in most granule cells of the cerebellum and Pax7 expression was found only in the ventricular zone. In the rostral rhombomere 1, Pax7 labeling was detected in cells of the ventricular zone of the alar plate, but numerous migrated cells were located in the basal plate, including the griseum centrale and the interpeduncular nucleus. Pax6 cells also formed a column of scattered neurons in the reticular formation and were found in the octavolateral area. The rhombencephalic ventricular zone of the alar plate expressed Pax7. Dorsal Pax7 cells and ventral Pax6 cells were found along the spinal cord separated from the ventricle, which did not show immunoreactivity. Our results show that the expression of Pax6 and Pax7 is widely maintained in the adult brain of Xenopus, like in urodele amphibians and in contrast to the situation described in amniotes. Therefore, in amphibians these transcription factors seem to be needed to maintain specific entities of subpopulations of neurons in the adult CNS.",

In the unlesioned contralateral striatum and nucleus accumbens surprisingly high numbers of resident GFP-positive neurons (about 2653 and 422 per striatum and accumbens, respectively) were observed while only much lower TH-positive neurons (about 214 and 102 per striatum and accumbens, respectively) were detectable.

Neurons producing melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) or hypocretin/orexin (Hcrt) have been implicated in the sleep/wake cycle and feeding behavior. Sleep and feeding habits vary greatly among mammalian species, depending in part of the prey/predatory status of animals. However, the distribution of both peptides has been described in only a limited number of species. In this work, we describe the distribution of MCH neurons in the brain of the domestic pig. Using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, their cell bodies are shown to be located in the posterior lateral hypothalamic area (LHA), as expected. They form a dense cluster ventro-lateral to the fornix while only scattered cells are present dorsal to this tract. By comparison, Hcrt cell bodies are located mainly dorsal to the fornix. Therefore, the two populations of neurons display complementary distributions in the posterior LHA. MCH projections are, as indicated by MCH-positive axons, very abundant in all cortical fields ventral to the rhinal sulcus, as well as in the lateral, basolateral and basomedial amygdala. In contrast, most of the isocortex is sparsely innervated. To conclude, the distribution of MCH cell bodies and projections shows some very specific features in the pig brain, that are clearly different of that described in the rat, mouse or human. In contrast, the Hcrt pattern seems more similar to that in these species, i.e. more conserved. These results suggest that the LHA anatomic organization shows some very significant interspecies differences, which may be related to the different behavioral repertoires of animals with regard to feeding and sleep/wake cycles.",

The intercalated cell groups of the amygdala (ITCs) are clusters of GABAergic neurons which exert powerful modulatory control of amygdala output, and are thought to play key roles in the extinction of conditioned fear responses. Dopamine, acting through D1 receptors, inhibits ITC neuronal activity, an action that has the potential to disinhibit amygdala activity, leading to changes in behavioral responses. Dopaminergic neurotransmission in the ITC occurs through a combination of synaptic and volume transmission. Thus, mechanisms, including transport mechanisms, that regulate extracellular dopamine concentrations in the ITC, are likely to be important determinants of amygdala function. We have recently demonstrated the expression of organic cation transporter 3 (OCT3), a high-capacity transporter for dopamine and other monoamines, throughout the rat brain. In this study, we used immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence techniques to examine the distribution of OCT3 in the ITC, to identify the phenotype of OCT3-expressing cells, and to describe the spatial relationships of OCT3 to dopaminergic terminals and dopamine D1 receptors in these areas. We observed high densities of OCT3-immunoreactive perikarya and punctae throughout the D1 receptor-rich main, anterior and paracapsular ITCs, in contrast with the basolateral amygdala, where OCT3 immunoreactive perikarya and puncta were observed at much lower density. OCT3-immunoreactive perikarya in the ITC were identified as neurons. Tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive fibers in the ITC were immunonegative for OCT3, though OCT3-immunoreactive punctae were observed in close proximity to TH+ terminals. Punctate OCT3-immunoreactivity in the ITCs was observed in very close proximity (<1m) to D1 receptor immunoreactivity. These anatomical data are consistent with the hypothesis that OCT3 plays a central role in regulating dopaminergic neurotransmission in the ITC, and that it represents a post- or peri-synaptic dopamine clearance mechanism. Inhibition of OCT3-mediated transport by corticosterone may represent a mechanism by which acute stress alters dopaminergic neurotransmission in the amygdala, leading to alterations in fear and anxiety-like behavior.",

Aromatase positive cells were found in three unique regions in the telencephalon.  Telencephalic aromatase may modulate responses to visual and acoustic stimuli. The enzyme aromatase is important for regulating sexual and aggressive behaviors during the reproductive season, including many aspects of courtship. In birds, aromatase is expressed at high levels in a number of different brain regions. Although this expression does vary among species, the extent to which the distribution of aromatase positive cells reflects species differences in courtship and other behaviors is not well established. Here, we examine the distribution of aromatase immunoreactive (ARO) neurons in the brain of a species with a unique courtship display, the ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus). Unlike most other galliforms, male ruffed grouse do not vocalize as part of their courtship and instead use their wings to create a non-vocal auditory signal to attract females. Because aromatase is involved in courtship behaviors in several bird species, including other galliforms, we hypothesized that aromatase distribution in the ruffed grouse would differ from that of other galliforms. We used an antibody raised against quail aromatase to examine aromatase immunoreactivity in the ruffed grouse, the closely related spruce grouse (Falcipennis canadensis) and the Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica). In all three species, ARO neurons were identified in the medial preoptic nucleus, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and the nucleus ventromedialis hypothalami. Both grouse species had ARO neurons in two regions of the telencephalon, the hyperpallium, and entopallium, and the ruffed grouse also in field L. ARO neurons were only found in one region in the telencephalon of the Japanese quail, the septum. In general, breeding male ruffed grouse had significantly more ARO neurons and those neurons were larger than that of both the non-breeding male and female ruffed grouse. Aromatase expression in the telencephalon of the ruffed grouse suggests that steroid hormones might modulate responses to visual and acoustic stimuli, but how this relates to species differences in courtship displays and co-expression with estrogenic receptors is yet to be determined.",

To broaden the understanding of the neural control and evolution of the sleepwake cycle in mammals, the distribution and interrelations of sleep associated nuclei with neurons and terminal networks expressing the calcium-binding proteins parvalbumin, calbindin and calretinin were explored in a rodent that lacks a significant visual system. The sleep-associated nuclei explored include the cholinergic basal forebrain and pontine nuclei, the catecholaminergic locus coeruleus complex, the serotonergic dorsal raphe nuclear complex, the hypothalamic orexinergic nuclei, and the thalamic reticular nucleus. Zambian mole-rat brains were sectioned and stained in a one in nine series for Nissl, myelin, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), serotonin (5HT), orexin (OrxA), calbindin (CB), calretinin (CR) and parvalbumin (PV). We observed that while the density of immunopositive calbindin (CB+) neurons and terminal networks varied in the different sleep related nuclei, they were found in all nuclei apart from the compact and diffuse subdivisions of the subcoeruleus, which lacked CB+ neurons but evinced a CB+ terminal network. The density of calretinin immunopositive (CR+) neurons and terminal networks varied between the sleep related nuclei, but was present in all nuclei examined. Neurons and terminal networks associated with PV immunoreactivity were the most sparsely distributed in these nuclei, but were present in the majority of nuclei. The thalamic reticular nucleus had the highest density of PV+ neurons and terminal networks, while PV+ neurons were absent in the cholinergic pontine nuclei, and PV+ neurons and terminal networks were absent in the orexinergic nuclei. The increased presence of neurons and terminal networks expressing the calcium binding proteins in comparison to that seen in the laboratory rat, specifically in the brainstem, may account for the prominent muscle twitches during REM sleep previously observed in this subterranean African rodent.",

Injections of the anterograde tracer, biotinylated dextran amine in the CnF of Sasco Sprague-Dawley rats labeled axons located near noradrenergic neurons that were visualized by processing tissue sections for tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactivity. Anterogradely labeled axons were more dense on the side ipsilateral to the BDA deposit. Both A7 and A5 cell groups received dense projections from neurons in the CnF, whereas locus coeruleus received only a sparse projection. Highly varicose anterogradely labeled axons from the CnF were found in close apposition to dendrites and somata of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive neurons in pontine tegmentum. Although definitive evidence for direct pathways from CnF neurons to the pontine noradrenergic cell groups requires ultrastructural analysis, the results of the present studies provide presumptive evidence of direct projections from neurons in the CnF to the pontine noradrenergic neurons of the A7, locus coeruleus, and A5 cell groups.

Dexamethasone effect is different in CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons of dorsal hippocampus and CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons of ventral hippocampus.  Total dendritic length of apical and basilar trees of ventral CA3 neurons is bigger than dorsal CA3 neurons in vehicle groups.  Dexamethasone induces a decrease of dendritic spine density in pyramidal neurons of dorsal and ventral hippocampus. Dexamethasone (DEX), a synthetic glucocorticoid widely used in neurological illnesses because of its antiinflammatory properties, has many serious side effects, including severe psychiatric symptoms such as psychoses. The hippocampus is divided in the dorsal hippocampus (DH) and ventral hippocampus (VH) with each region having a subfield of CA1 and CA3 pyramidal layers. Great interest has recently emerged showing that the DH and VH are functionally different. In our work we determined whether, and what, changes occurred, after five days of DEX (0.2mg/kg) treatment, on the dendritic morphology of the CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons of the DH and VH of adult Sprague-Dawley rats. The dendritic morphology and characteristics were measured by using the Golgi-Cox procedure followed by a Sholl analysis. DEX decreased the number of dendritic spines of both apical and basolateral dendrites. Interestingly, this decrease was more pronounced in the VH. Only the VH neurons were affected by DEX with a decrease in their total dendritic length (TDL). An interesting point is that the VH neurons are longer that the DH neurons among the groups injected with saline only as the control. The length per branch order was only altered in the apical dendritic tree of the CA1 neurons. These data taken together show that the VH is more susceptible to DEX and its neurons are larger than the DH neurons. These results support previous observations related to differences between the DH and VH and suggest differences in the expression of the glucocorticoid receptors in connectivity and the space to elongate their dendritic arbor.",

In humans, depression has been associated with disturbances in olfactory circuitry. Symptoms of depression can be mimicked in animals after olfactory bulbectomy (OBX). Animal models of depression-like behavior produce similar neuronal rearrangements in various brain regions as seen in patients affected by depression. We have recently observed that OBX produces neuronal hypotrophy in the piriform cortex (PirC) and CA1 hippocampus as well as decreased adult cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus (DG) of hippocampus. Thus we further evaluated the effects of OBX in neuronal arborization and spine density in brain regions involved in the control of circadian circle, emotion and memory processing such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC), nucleus accumbens (NAcc), infralimbic cortex (ILC), orbitolateral cortex (OLC) and entorhinal cortex (EC).

New sequence data on CRF family members from a number of genomes has led to the modification of our understanding of CRF evolution in the Metazoa. The corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) family of peptides include four paralogous lineages in jawed vertebrates; CRF, urotensin-I/urocortin/sauvagine, urocortin 2 (Ucn2) and urocortin 3 (Ucn3). CRF and the urotensin-I/urocortin/sauvagine group represent a gene duplication from one lineage, whereas Ucns 2 and 3 are the result of a gene duplication in the other paralogous lineage. Both paralogous lineages are the result of a gene duplication from a single ancestral peptide that occurred after the divergence of the tunicates from the ancestor that led to the evolution of chordates and vertebrates. The presence of a single CRF-like peptide in tunicates and insects suggests that a single CRF-like ancestor was present before the separation of deuterostomes and protostomes. Currently there is no strong evidence that indicates that CRF-like peptides were present in metazoan taxa that evolved before this time although the structural similarity between some CRF peptides in insects, tunicates and vertebrates with the calcitonin family of peptides hints that prior to the formation of deuterostomes and protostomes the ancestral peptide possessed both CRF and calcitonin-like structural attributes. Here, we show evidences of conservation of CRF-like function dating back to early prokaryotes. This ancestral CRFcalcitonin-like peptide may have initially resulted from a horizontal gene transfer event from prokaryotes to a protistan species that later gave rise to the metazoans.",

Despite the regional overlapping, there was no evidence of double-labeling between BrdU and DCX. Therefore, the VZ in the brain of adult pigeons seems to have rapidly dividing cells as putative progenitors of newborn neurons populating the forebrain.

Pharmacological manipulation of phosphodiesterases (PDEs) provokes profound anti-inflammatory responses through modulation of cAMP levels. The PDE4B subfamily has been related to the inflammatory immune response in mice and PDE4 inhibition produces amelioration of the clinical signs and delayed onset in the EAE model. Analyses of the expression of the mRNA coding for PDE4B splice variants revealed an upregulation of PDE4B2 in the brainstem and spinal cord of EAE mice which correlated with forkhead box P3 (FoxP3) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-[beta]) mRNAs expression in a score-dependent manner. The increase observed for the PDE4B protein was mainly found in antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells and microglia/macrophages, in areas with high cellular infiltration. Unexpectedly, PDE4B-/- mice showed an earlier onset of the disease compared to wildtype mice. The results point to a possible role of the PDE4B enzyme and in particular the PDE4B2 splice variant during EAE pathogenesis, probably by modulating cAMP levels in APCs, consequently influencing the cytokine environment important for T-cell differentiation.",

Although some early reports described the 5-HT innervation of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in rats, the focus was on sensorimotor regions and not on the alimbica PFC a or on the medial, orbital and insular cortices. In addition, no reports have described the distribution of 5-HT fibers to PFC in rats using antisera to the serotonin transporter (SERT). Using immunostaining for SERT, we examined the pattern of distribution of 5-HT fibers to the medial, orbital and insular cortices in the rat. We show that 5-HT fibers distribute massively throughout all divisions of the PFC, with distinct laminar variations. Specifically, 5-HT fibers were densely concentrated in superficial (layer 1) and deep (layers 5/6) of the PFC but less heavily so in intermediate layers (layers 2/3). This pattern was most pronounced in the orbital cortex, particularly in the ventral and ventrolateral orbital cortices. With the emergence of granular divisions of the insular cortex, the granular cell layer (layer 4) was readily identifiable by a dense band of labeling confined to it, separating layer 4 from less heavily labeled superficial and deep layers. The pattern of 5-HT innervation of medial, orbital and insular cortices significantly differed from that of sensorimotor regions of the PFC. Serotonergic labeling was much denser overall in limbic compared to non-limbic regions of the PFC, as was striking demonstrated by the generally weaker labeling in layers 1a3 of the primary sensory and motor cortices. The massive serotonergic innervation of the medial, orbital and insular divisions of the PFC likely contributes substantially to well established serotonergic effects on affective and cognitive functions, including a key role in many neurological and psychiatric diseases.",

The cerebellar cortex has a fundamental parasagittal organization that is reflected in the physiological responses of Purkinje cells, projections of Purkinje cells, afferent inputs from climbing and mossy fibres and the expression of several molecular markers. The most thoroughly studied of these molecular markers is zebrin II (ZII; a.k.a. aldolase C). ZII is differentially expressed in Purkinje cells, resulting in a pattern of sagittal stripes of high expression (ZII+ve) interdigitated with stripes of little or no expression (ZIIve). The calcium binding protein calretinin (CR) is expressed heavily in mossy fibres terminating throughout the cerebellar cortex, but whether CR is heterogeneously expressed in parasagittal stripes, like ZII, is unknown. In this study, we examined CR expression in the cerebellum of pigeons and compared it to that of ZII. CR was expressed heavily in the granule layer in mossy fibres and their terminal rosettes. Moreover, CR is expressed heterogeneously in the granule layer such that there are sagittal stripes of heavy CR labelling (CR+ve) alternating with stripes of weaker labelling (CRve). The CR heterogeneity is most notable in folium IXcd and folia IIIV in the anterior lobe. In the anterior lobe, the central CR+ve stripe spanning the midline is aligned with the central ZII+ve stripe, whereas the other CR+ve stripes are aligned with the ZIIve stripes. In IXcd, the CR+ve stripes are aligned with the ZII+ve stripes. This combination of aligned and unaligned CR+ve stripes, relative to ZII+ve stripes, differs from that of parvalbumin and other neurochemical markers, but the functional consequences of this is unclear. With respect to the posterior lobe, we suggest that the CR+ve mossy fibres to IXcd originate in two retinal recipient nuclei that are involved in the processing of optic flow.",

Telencephalic dopamine cells differ in gene expression profiles from those in the diencephalon.  Striking similarities between mammals and teleosts are found. Across vertebrates, the mesolimbic reward system is a highly conserved neural network that serves to evaluate the salience of environmental stimuli, with dopamine as the neurotransmitter most relevant to its function. Although brain regions in the dopaminergic reward system have been well characterized in mammals, homologizing these brain areas with structures in teleosts has been controversial, especially for the mesencephalo-diencephalic dopaminergic cell populations. Here we examine the neurochemical profile of five dopaminergic cell groups (Vc, POA, PPr, TPp, pTn) in the model cichlid Astatotilapia burtoni to better understand putative homology relationships between teleosts and mammals. We characterized in the adult brain the expression patterns of three genes (etv5, nr4a2, and pitx3) that either specify dopaminergic cell fate or maintain dopaminergic cell populations. We then determined whether these genes are expressed in dopaminergic cells. We find many striking similarities in these gene expression profiles between dopaminergic cell populations in teleosts and their putative mammalian homologs. Our results suggest that many of these dopaminergic cell groups are indeed evolutionarily ancient and conserved across vertebrates.",

Moderately elevated corticosterone replacement had no effect on CA3 cell morphology. Plastic changes in the adult mammal hippocampus can be altered by many factors and perhaps the most well-documented is stress. Stress and elevated corticosterone levels have been shown to decrease hippocampal neurogenesis and decrease the complexity of CA3 pyramidal neurons. However, the extent of these changes in relation to low and moderately elevated levels of corticosterone has yet to be fully investigated. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine how low to moderately elevated circulating corticosterone levels affect dendritic morphology of CA3 pyramidal cells and hippocampal neurogenesis in adult male rats. To do this, three groups of adult male Wistar rats were used: (1) Sham-operated, (2) Adrenalectomized (ADX), and (3) ADX+corticosterone replacement. Primary results show that adrenalectomy, but not moderately elevated levels of corticosterone replacement, resulted in significant atrophy of CA3 pyramidal neurons. Interestingly, moderate corticosterone replacement resulted in significantly more surviving new cells in the dentate gyrus when compared to sham controls.

Using a double immunofluorescence procedure, we report the discovery of a novel group of fibrous astrocytes that co-express epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) -subunit protein along with glial acidic fibrillary protein (GFAP). These cells are concentrated along the borders of the sensory circumventricular organs (CVOs), embedded in the white matter (e.g., optic nerve/chiasm, anterior commissure, corpus callosum, pyramidal tract) and are components of the pia mater.

Thus, the distribution of catecholaminergic cell groups in the alpaca diencephalon agrees with that previously described in the diencephalon of other mammalian species of the same order: the A11, A12, A13, A14 and A15d cell groups have been identified; however, we have observed an additional hitherto undescribed cell group containing tyrosine hydroxylase in the medial habenula. In addition, double-labelling procedures did not reveal neurons containing tyrosine hydroxylase and somatostatin, suggesting that the hypothalamic interactions between catecholamines and somatostatin at intra-cellular level must be carried out by a somatostatin molecule other than fragment (1-12). Otherwise, the overlapping distribution patterns of these substances would suggest some interconnections between groups of chemospecific neurons. These results could be the starting point for future studies on hypothalamic functions in alpacas, for example those concerning reproductive control, since other physiological studies have suggested that this species could have different regulatory mechanisms from other mammalian species.

The present study describes the distribution of orexin-A immunoreactive neurons and their terminal networks in the brains of two species of megachiropterans. In general the organization of the orexinergic system in the mammalian brain is conserved across species, but as one of two groups of mammals that fly and have a high metabolic rate, it was of interest to determine whether there were any specific differences in the organization of this system in the megachiropterans. Orexinergic neurons were limited in distribution to the hypothalamus, and formed three distinct clusters, or nuclei, a main cluster with a perifornical location, a zona incerta cluster in the dorsolateral hypothalamus and an optic tract cluster in the ventrolateral hypothalamus. The nuclear parcellation of the orexinergic system in the megachiropterans is similar to that seen in many mammals, but differs from the microchiropterans where the optic tract cluster is absent. The terminal networks of the orexinergic neurons in the megachiropterans was similar to that seen in a range of mammalian species, with significant terminal networks being found in the hypothalamus, cholinergic pedunculopontine and laterodorsal tegemental nuclei, the noradrenergic locus coeruleus complex, all serotonergic nuclei, the paraventricular nuclei of the epithalamus and adjacent to the habenular nuclei.

The sequestration of glutamate into synaptic vesicles, and the subsequent transport of filled vesicles to the presynaptic terminal membrane, is regulated by a family of proteins known as vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs). Two VGLUT proteins, VGLUT1 and VGLUT2, characterize distinct sets of glutamatergic projections between visual structures in rodents and prosimian primates, yet little is known about their distributions in the visual system of anthropoid primates. We have examined the mRNA and protein expression patterns of VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 in the visual system of macaque monkeys, an Old World anthropoid primate, in order to determine their relative distributions in the superior colliculus, lateral geniculate nucleus, pulvinar complex, V1 and V2. Distinct expression patterns for both VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 identified architectonic boundaries in all structures, as well as anatomical subdivisions of the superior colliculus, pulvinar complex, and V1. These results suggest that VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 clearly identify regions of glutamatergic input in visual structures, and may identify common architectonic features of visual areas and nuclei across the primate radiation. Additionally, we find that VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 characterize distinct subsets of glutamatergic projections in the macaque visual system; VGLUT2 predominates in driving or feedforward projections from lower order to higher order visual structures while VGLUT1 predominates in modulatory or feedback projections from higher order to lower order visual structures. The distribution of these two proteins suggests that VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 may identify class 1 and class 2 type glutamatergic projections within the primate visual system (Sherman and Guillery, 2006).",

Despite their critical contribution in modulating neuronal excitability during development and adult, the spatiotemporal expression of specific GIRK subunits in identified cerebellar neuron populations is unresolved. To characterize this onset of expression, we examined the GIRK2 protein expression in mouse cerebellum by western blot, light microscopy immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence during perinatal development. Using western blots, GIRK2 expression was low at birth but reach its maximum at P5 before decreasing gradually to adult levels. Immunohistochemical localization indicated that GIRK2 is expressed in granule cells from early stages of development. At the embryonic stage, immunofluorescence techniques for the transcription factor Pax6 allowed to demonstrate that GIRK2 is expressed in granule cell precursors. This GIRK2 expression in granule cells continued throughout postnatal development and adulthood. In addition, the expression of Pax2-GFP allowed selective visualization of Golgi cells during pre- and postnatal development. We could not detect co-expression of Pax2-GFP and GIRK2 during prenatal and early postnatal development, but only at post-migratory stages of Golgi cells, once they are morphologically differentiated and located at the granule cell layer. In the adult cerebellum, we performed a detailed characterization on the expression of GIRK2 in different subpopulations of Golgi cells, using metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 (mGlu2) and neurogranin as markers, in GlyT2-GFP and GAD67-GFP mice, and showed that GIRK2 is present in at least four morphological and neurochemical non-overlapping populations of Golgi cells. Altogether, these findings shed new light on the developmental regulation of GIRK channels in the cerebellum, and the main expression in granule cells during perinatal development support the idea that GIRK2 may provide a significant route for modulating different aspects of cerebellar development.",

One of these feedback loops is operated by the mineralocorticoid (MR) and glucocorticoid receptors (GR) that mediate in complementary fashion the action of endogenous cortisol/corticosterone in brain circuits underlying the onset and termination of the stress response. By affecting appraisal processes MR has an important role in coordinating emotional expression and cognitive flexibility with the onset of the stress response, while GR's role is prominent in the management of behavioral and physiological adaptations during the recovery phase. Genetic variation in interaction with environmental input and experience-related factors can modulate this balance between susceptibility and recovery governed by a balanced MR:GR signaling.

Our recent studies have shown that the distribution of calretinin (CR) in the anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN) changes significantly during the development of the guinea pig. The present study was designed to reveal the distribution pattern of calcium-binding proteins, i.e. calbindin (CB) and parvalbumin (PV), as well as the colocalization pattern of all three proteins, including CR, in the ATN of guinea pigs ranging from the 40th embryonic day (E40) to the 80th postnatal day (P80). According to these patterns, CB appears exclusively in the perikarya of the anteromedial nucleus (AM) not before P20 and always colocalizes with CR. Moreover, CB and CR colocalize in fibers of thin bundles traversing the anteroventral nucleus (AV) since E50. The ATN also display CB-positive neuropil in all studied stages, especially a strong one in the ventral part of the AV. PV was not observed in the perikarya of the ATN in all the stages, but was abundantly present in the neuropil of the anterodorsal nucleus (AD). No colocalizations exist between PV and the rest of the studied proteins. In conclusion, our study reveals that the distribution of the studied proteins differs greatly. Nevertheless, the postnatal coexistence of CB and CR in the AM perikarya may indicate the cooperation of both of the proteins in some functions of the nucleus. Parvalbumin is limited mostly to the neuropil of the AD, suggesting different functions in comparison to CB and CR.",

Numerous motivated behaviors require simultaneous activation of somatomotor and autonomic functions. We have previously characterized the organization of brain circuits that may mediate this integration. Presympathetic premotor neurons (PSPMNs) that are part of such circuits are distributed across multiple brain regions, which mediate stress-elicited behavioral and physiological responses, including the EdingerWestphal nucleus (EW). Based on its connectivity and function, EW has recently been re-classified into a preganglionic (EWpg) and a centrally projecting (EWcp) population. Neurons within EWcp are the major source of urocortin 1 (Ucn-1), an analog of the corticotropin-releasing factor that binds the CRFR1 and CRFR2 receptors and has been implicated in mediating homeostatic responses to stress. We hypothesized that a subset of EWcp PSPMNs expresses Ucn-1. Utilizing dual-label immunofluorescence, we initially mapped the distribution of Ucn-1 and cholinergic neurons within EW in colchicine pre-treated rats. Based on this labeling we divided EWcp into three neuroanatomical levels. To examine connections of EWcp neurons to the gastrocnemius muscle and the adrenal gland, we next employed trans-synaptic tract-tracing in a second group of rats, utilizing two pseudorabies virus (PRV) recombinants that express unique reporter proteins. Using multi-label immunofluorescent staining, we identified the presence of Ucn-1-positive PSPMNs, dually labeled with PRV and present throughout the entire extent of EWcp and intermingled with Ucn-1 neurons infected with one or neither of the viral recombinants. Compared to rats pretreated with colchicine, we observed significantly fewer Ucn-1 neurons in animals that received PRV injections. Post hoc analyses revealed significantly fewer Ucn-1 neurons at the rostral level as compared to the caudal and middle levels. These data suggest functional and anatomic heterogeneity within EWcp; this organization may coordinate various aspects of stress-elicited and emotionally salient behaviors.",

The teleostean dorsomedial pallium is the best candidate for the lateral/basolateral amygdala.  The supracommissural and postcommissural subpallia are the best candidates for the extended central amygdala.  These subpallial regions also present some markers of the medial amygdala.  The parcelation of central and medial amygdala occurred with the appearance of a true vomeronasal system. The amygdaloid nuclei form an important hub of structures associated with diverse aspects of cognition and emotional behavior. Homologous structures have been determined in tetrapods, but homology of amygdala-like regions in bony fishes is presently unclear. Based on connectivity patterns, genoarchitecture, chemical neuroanatomy, and functional studies, we suggest that the dorsomedial portion of the pallium of Actinopterygii is the homolog of the basolateral/lateral amygdala (frontotemporal amygdaloid system), while the supracommissural and postcommissural portions of the subpallium are homologous to the extended central amygdala (central amygdaloid nucleus and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis). Nonetheless, the differentiation between these nuclei is not as clear-cut as in mammals, and there is no clear evidence for the existence of an olfactory medial amygdala in Actinopterygii, suggesting that the parcellation of one or two amygdaloid nuclei into many subnuclei occurred with the appearance of a true vomeronasal system.",

Orexin is a neuropeptide that has been implicated in several processes, such as induction of appetite, arousal and alertness and sleep/wake regulation. Multiple lines of evidence also suggest that orexin is involved in the stress response. When orexin is administered intracerebroventricular it activates the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA)-axis, which is the main regulator of the stress response. The HPA-axis is not the only player in the stress response evidence suggests that urocortin 1 (Ucn1), a member of the corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) neuropeptide family, also plays an important role in the stress response adaptation. Ucn1 is primarily synthetized in the centrally projecting EdingerWestphal nucleus (EWcp), which also receives dense innervation by orexin terminals. In this study we tested the hypothesis that orexin would directly shape the response of EWcp-Ucn1 neurons to acute cold stress. To test this hypothesis, we first assessed whether orexinergic axon terminals would innervate EWcp-Ucn1/CART neurons, and next we exposed orexin deficient (orexin-KO) male mice and their male wild-type (WT) littermates to acute cold stress for 2h. We also assessed stress-associated changes in plasma corticosterone (CORT), as well as the activation of Ucn1/CART neurons in the EWcp nucleus. We found that orexin immunoreactive axon terminals were juxtaposed to EWcp-Ucn1/CART neurons, which also expressed orexin receptor 1 mRNA. Furthermore, acute stress strongly activated the EWcp-Ucn1/CART neurons and increased plasma CORT in both WT littermates and orexin-KO mice, however no genotype effect was found on these indices. Taken together our data show that orexin in general is not involved in the animal's acute stress response (plasma CORT) and it does not play a direct role in shaping the response of EWcp-Ucn1 neurons to acute stress either.",

Glutamate-induced excitotoxicity is a major contributor to motor neuron (MN) degeneration in disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), stroke and spinal cord injury. Numerous in vitro and in vivo models have been developed to evaluate the efficacy and mode of action of neuroprotective agents. However, the dominance of glutamate receptor-subtype in the different regions of the spinal cord in these models has generally been overlooked. This study first compared the neuroprotective effect of administering glutamate receptor antagonists, (+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine (MK-801) and 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX), into a serum-free excitotoxic organotypic in vitro system, on the survival of MNs located in the lumbar area of spinal cord. The poor neuroprotection provided by MK-801 (NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartate) antagonist) in comparison to CNQX (AMPA/KA (a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate/kainate) antagonist), raised the hypothesis that the extent of engagement by glutamate receptor sub-types in the mechanism of excitotoxicity may differ within different populations of MNs. The consequent examination of MN susceptibility to glutamate-induced excitotoxicity in relation to the rostro-caudal level from which MN originated revealed a differential glutamate receptor sub-type dominance at different spinal cord regions (i.e. cervical, thoracic and lumbar). In the cervical and lumbar regions, the AMPA receptor was the main contributor to MN excitotoxicity, whereas in thoracic regions, the NMDA receptor was the main contributor. This study provides a new way of looking at mechanisms leading to glutamate-induced excitotoxicity in MN and may therefore be important for the development of treatment strategies in protection of spinal MNs in neurodegenerative disease and traumatic injury.",

Zebra finch song is a learned behavior dependent upon successful progress through a sensitive period of late-postnatal development. This learning is associated with maturation of distinct brain nuclei and the fiber tract interconnections between them. We have previously found remarkably distinct and dense CB1 cannabinoid receptor expression within many of these song control brain regions, implying a normal role for endocannabinoid signaling in vocal learning. Activation of CB1 receptors via daily treatments with exogenous agonist during sensorimotor stages of song learning (but not in adulthood) results in persistent alteration of song patterns. Now we are working to understand physiological changes responsible for this cannabinoid-altered vocal learning. We have found that song-altering developmental treatments are associated with changes in expression of endocannabinoid signaling elements, including CB1 receptors and the principal CNS endogenous agonist, 2-AG. Within CNS, 2-AG is produced largely through activity of the  isoform of the enzyme diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL). To better appreciate the role of 2-AG production in normal vocal development we have determined the spatial distribution of DAGL expression within zebra finch CNS during vocal development. Early during vocal development at 25 days, DAGL staining is typically light and of fibroid processes. Staining peaks late in the sensorimotor stage of song learning at 75 days and is characterized by fiber, neuropil and some staining of both small and large cell somata. Results provide insight to the normal role for endocannabinoid signaling in the maturation of brain regions responsible for song learning and vocal-motor output, and suggest mechanisms by which exogenous cannabinoid exposure alters acquisition of this form of vocal communication.",

As influenza infection is mediated by specific receptors on the host cell surface, it is important to understand the distribution patterns of influenza receptors in target organs. We carried out comprehensive experiments to localize influenza receptors in the brains of two different mouse strains and the human brain for comparison using lectin histochemistry. We further compared the brain regions in which influenza receptors were expressed and the regions in which experimental influenza infection was observed. Our results show that the expression patterns for influenza receptors in mouse and human brains are different. In the mouse brain, human influenza virus receptors (HuIV-R) were expressed in part of brainstem and cerebellar white matter while avian influenza virus receptors (AIV-R) were expressed in the cerebellar Purkinje neurons. In contrast, in the human brain, many neurons and glia in widespread regions, including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, brainstem, and cerebellum, express both AIV-R and HuIV-R. Importantly, vascular endothelial cells, choroid plexus epithelial cells and ependymal cells in both mouse and human brains express high levels of HuIV-R and AIV-R.

We demonstrated that serotonergic fibers distribute massively to the three divisions of the PFC and each of their subdivisions. They include the medial, orbital and insular divisions of the PFC. By contrast, the 5-HT innervation of sensorimotor regions of the PFC was considerably less pronounced.  These findings indicate a marked 5-HT influence on the PFC likely critically involved in the modulation of affective and cognitive behaviors associated with the PFC. As is well recognized, serotonergic (5-HT) fibers distribute widely throughout the brain, including the cerebral cortex. Although some early reports described the 5-HT innervation of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in rats, the focus was on sensorimotor regions and not on the limbic PFC  or on the medial, orbital and insular cortices. In addition, no reports have described the distribution of 5-HT fibers to PFC in rats using antisera to the serotonin transporter (SERT). Using immunostaining for SERT, we examined the pattern of distribution of 5-HT fibers to the medial, orbital and insular cortices in the rat. We show that 5-HT fibers distribute massively throughout all divisions of the PFC, with distinct laminar variations. Specifically, 5-HT fibers were densely concentrated in superficial (layer 1) and deep (layers 5/6) of the PFC but less heavily so in intermediate layers (layers 2/3). This pattern was most pronounced in the orbital cortex, particularly in the ventral and ventrolateral orbital cortices. With the emergence of granular divisions of the insular cortex, the granular cell layer (layer 4) was readily identifiable by a dense band of labeling confined to it, separating layer 4 from less heavily labeled superficial and deep layers. The pattern of 5-HT innervation of medial, orbital and insular cortices significantly differed from that of sensorimotor regions of the PFC.

Brains of the golden mole, sengi and giant otter shrew were coronally sectioned and immunohistochemically stained with antibodies against cholineacetyl-transferase, tyrosine hydroxylase, serotonin and orexin-A. The majority of nuclei revealed in the current study were similar among the species investigated, to other Afrotherian species, and to mammals generally, but certain differences in the nuclear complement highlighted phylogenetic interrelationships. The golden mole was observed to have cholinergic interneurons in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, olfactory bulb and amygdala. The four-toed sengi had cholinergic neurons in both colliculi and in the cochlear nucleus, but lacked the catecholaminergic A15d group in the hypothalamus. In both the golden mole and the four-toed sengi, the locus coeruleus (A6d group) was made up of few neurons.

To examine the mechanisms contributing to pain genesis in diabetic neuropathy, we investigated epidermal thickness and number of intraepidermal nerve fibers in rat foot pad of the animal model of diabetes type 1 and type 2 in relation to pain-related behavior. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were used. Diabetes type 1 was induced with intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ) and diabetes type 2 was induced with a combination of STZ and high-fat diet. Control group for diabetes type 1 was fed with regular laboratory chow, while control group for diabetes type 2 received high-fat diet. Body weights and blood glucose levels were monitored to confirm induction of diabetes. Pain-related behavior was analyzed using thermal (hot, cold) and mechanical stimuli (von Frey fibers, number of hyperalgesic responses). Two months after induction of diabetes, glabrous skin samples from plantar surface of the both hind paws were collected. Epidermal thickness was evaluated with hematoxylin and eosin staining. Intraepidermal nerve fibers quantification was performed after staining skin with polyclonal antiserum against protein gene product 9.5.

Many TH-ir cells in other prairie vole forebrain and midbrain sites also do not contain AADC.  These monoenzymatic TH-ir cells are unlikely to be DAergic, but perhaps DOPAergic.  AADC-ir cells were also found in many non-catecholaminergic brain regions. Neurons synthesizing dopamine (DA) are widely distributed in the brain and implicated in a tremendous number of physiological and behavioral functions, including socioreproductive behaviors in rodents. We have recently been investigating the possible involvement of sex- and species-specific TH-immunoreactive (TH-ir) cells in the male prairie vole ( Microtus ochrogaster) principal bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (pBST) and posterodorsal medial amygdala (MeApd) in the chemosensory control of their monogamous pairbonding and parenting behaviors. These TH-ir cells are not immunoreactive for dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH), suggesting they are not noradrenergic but possibly DAergic. A DAergic phenotype would require them to contain aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) and here we examined the existence of cells immunoreactive for both TH and AADC in the pBST and MeApd of adult virgin male and female prairie voles. We also investigated the presence of TH/AADC cells in the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV), medial preoptic area (MPO), arcuate nucleus (ARH), zona incerta (ZI), substantia nigra (SN) and ventral tegmental area (VTA). Among our findings were: (1) the pBST and MeApd each contained completely non-overlapping distributions of TH-ir and AADC-ir cells, (2) the AVPV contained surprisingly few AADC-ir cells and almost no TH-ir cells contained AADC-ir, (3) approximately 60% of the TH-ir cells in the MPO, ARH, and ZI also contained AADC-ir, (4) unexpectedly, only about half of TH-ir cells in the SN and VTA contained AADC-ir, and (5) notable populations of AADC-ir cells were found outside traditional monoamine-synthesizing regions, including some sites that do not contain AADC-ir cells in adult laboratory rats or cats (medial septum and cerebral cortex). In the absence of the chemical requirements to produce DA, monoenzymatic TH-ir cells in the virgin adult prairie vole pBST, MeApd, and elsewhere in their brain may instead produce l-DOPA as an end product and use it as a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator, similar to what has been observed for monoenzymatic TH-synthesizing cells in the laboratory rat brain.",

Comparison between the primate pregeniculate nucleus and its homologous structure in rodents, the intergeniculate leaflet. In mammals, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and the intergeniculate leaflet (IGL) are the main components of the circadian timing system. The SCN is the site of the endogenous biological clock that generates rhythms and synchronizes them to environmental cues. The IGL is a key structure that modulates SCN activity and is responsible for the transmission of non-photic information to the SCN, thus participating in the integration between photic and non-photic stimuli. Both the SCN and IGL receive projections of retinal ganglion cells and the IGL is connected to the SCN through the geniculohypothalamic tract. Little is known about these structures in the primate brain and the pregeniculate nucleus (PGN) has been suggested to be the primate equivalent of the rodent IGL. The aim of this study was to characterize the PGN of a primate, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), and to analyze its retinal afferents. Here, the marmoset PGN was found to be organized into three subsectors based on neuronal size, pattern of retinal projections, and the distribution of neuropeptide Y-, GAD-, serotonin-, enkephalin- and substance P-labeled terminals. This pattern indicates that the marmoset PGN is equivalent to the IGL.

Surviving motor neurons possess morphological alterations, consisting of: pale bodies, nuclear envelope fragmentation, and loss of neuronal processes.  Surviving motor neurons possess altered alpha-synuclein immunostaining, as detected by three different monoclonal antibodies. 1-Methyl, 4-phenyl, 1,2,3,6-tetrahydropiridine (MPTP) is a neurotoxin, widely used to produce experimental models of Parkinson Disease in rodents and primates. Although dopaminergic neurons are the most sensitive to MPTP neurotoxicity, different neuronal subtypes are affected. Among these, recent studies indicate that MPTP may produce pathological effects on spinal neurons. In fact, MPTP activates apoptotic proteins within the spinal cord and in particular within the motor neurons, suggesting commonalities between Parkinson Disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. In order to assess this point, in the present study we measured whether MPTP produces motor neurons loss. We chose a dose of MPTP (20mg/kg3, 2h apart), which in C57BL/6N mice was able to induce a massive nigrostriatal damage. Since both Parkinson Disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis are characterized by altered alpha-synuclein immunostaining, this protein was also evaluated within spinal motor neurons, following MPTP administration. Three different monoclonal antibodies, recognizing distinct epitopes in the sequence of alpha-synuclein were used. Severe dopaminergic cell loss was quantified by stereology within the substantia nigra pars compacta, along with marked decrease of striatal tyrosine hydroxylase densitometry. The same doses of MPTP also caused a significant motor neuron loss in the spinal cord (roughly 30%). Spared motor neurons appeared often dysmorphic and vacuolated and possessed altered alpha-synuclein immunostaining. This latter finding extended to other cell types of the spinal cord. These data indicate that MPTP, apart from being a dopaminergic neurotoxin, produces also motor neuron death, thus bridging experimental Parkinsonism and motor neuron disease.",

Cholesterol transport proteins are a prerequisite for neurosteroidogenesis. Steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR)-related lipid transfer (START) domain-containing proteins, such as StAR and START domain-containing 6 (StarD6), are known to be distributed in the brain. Since perinatal hypothyroidism affects cerebellar development, we examined postnatal changes in StAR and StarD6 immunolocalization in the developing cerebellum of control and hypothyroid rats.

As shown by calbindin D-28k immunostaining, the developing cerebellar cytoarchitecture and Purkinje cells were affected by PTU-induced hypothyroidism as compared to control rats.

StAR immunostaining first appeared in the Purkinje cells of the vermis at P7 in both control and hypothyroid rats. In control rats, a few StarD6 immunoreactive cells were seen at birth and a nuclear localization of StarD6 in Purkinje cells was obvious at P14.

We illustrate that enkephalin immunoreactivity expressed in these two different neural systems varies considerably and is dependent on the reproductive state.  Enkephalin immunoreactivity in these two brain systems exhibited opposing patterns of expression.  Variation in enkephalin immunoreactivity may modulate the seasonal variation in the motivation to engage in song as well as song perception and/or song stereotypy. Many temperate zone songbird species exhibit marked seasonal variation in song quality as well as in the motivation to sing. Two brain systems are known to mediate such annual variation in song quality and motivation: (1) the song control system (SCS), and (2) the social behavior network (SBN), respectively. How these two circuits interact to produce changes in singing behavior is not well understood. The opioid enkephalin is expressed in both the SCS and SBN and may function to modulate song quality in a socially relevant manner. Using immunocytochemistry, we examined variation in enkephalin immunoreactivity (ENK-ir) in male European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) that were in breeding conditions (i.e. photostimulated) or non-breeding conditions (i.e. photorefractory). We also included a group of castrated photostimulated males to investigate the relationship between gonadal steroids and ENK-ir. ENK-ir in the preoptic area (POA) and lateral septum (LS) was greater in photostimulated intact birds as compared to photorefractory males, but not in other regions within the SBN. There was a significant difference in ENK-ir in two forebrain song nuclei, HVC and the lateral nucleus of the anterior medial nidopallium (lMAN), with lower expression in photostimulated intact as compared to photorefractory birds. ENK-ir did not change across breeding conditions in the Nucleus Interface (NIf). After accounting for the volumetric change in HVC and lMAN, the pattern of ENK-ir remained greater in photorefractory compared to intact photostimulated starlings. We propose that the observed regulation of ENK-ir in the POA and LS may be related to seasonal changes in the motivation to engage in singing behavior, while the change in ENK-ir in the song system are associated with the quality of the song produced. Thus seasonal changes in a single neuromodulatory system can have very different functional effects based on the neuroanatomical specificity of its expression.",

We have previously shown that application of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) to cut optic nerve axons enhances retinal ganglion cell (RGC) survival in the adult frog visual system. These actions are mediated via activation of its high affinity receptor FGFR1, enhanced BDNF and TrkB expression, increased CREB phosphorylation, and by promoting MAPK and PKA signaling pathways. The role of endogenous FGF-2 in this system is less well understood. In this study, we determine the distribution of FGF-2 and its receptors in normal animals and in animals at different times after optic nerve cut. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis were conducted using specific antibodies against FGF-2 and its receptors in control retinas and optic tecta, and after one, three, and six weeks post nerve injury. FGF-2 was transiently increased in the retina while it was reduced in the optic tectum just one week after optic nerve transection. Axotomy induced a prolonged upregulation of FGFR1 and FGFR3 in both retina and tectum.

The epithelial cells are linked by tight junctions to create a permeability barrier. The epithelial cells are derived from neuroectoderm, and are thus defined by some authors as a subtype of macroglia. Glutamate is a tightly regulated substance in the CSF, as it is in the rest of the brain. In the brain macroglia express multiple sodium dependent and independent glutamate transporters and are the main regulators of extracellular glutamate. However, the identities of the transporters in the choroid plexus and their localisations have remained poorly defined. In this study we examined the expression and distribution of multiple splice variants of classical sodium-dependent glutamate transporters, as well as the cystine-glutamate antiporter, and the PDZ protein NHERF1, (which acts as a molecular anchor for proteins such as the glutamate transporter GLAST). We identified three forms of sodium-dependent transporters (GLAST1a, GLAST1c and GLT1b) that are expressed at the apical surface of the epithelial cells, a location that matches the distribution of NHERF1 and the cystine-glutamate antiporter. We propose that this coincident localisation of GLAST1a/GLAST1c/GLT1b and the cystine-glutamate antiporter would permit the cyclical trafficking of glutamate and thus optimise the accumulation of cystine for the formation of glutathione in the choroid plexus.",

We propose that sensory stimulation could promote phenotypic plasticity. The mammalian brain preserves the ability to replace olfactory periglomerular cells (PGC) throughout life. Even though we have detailed a great deal the mechanisms underlying stem and amplifying cells maintenance and proliferation, as well as those modulating migration and differentiation, our knowledge on PGC phenotypic plasticity is at best fragmented and controversial. Here we explored whether chronically reinforced olfactory conditioning influences the phenotype of newborn PGC. Accordingly, olfactory conditioned rats showed increased numbers of GAD 65/67 positive PGC. Because such phenotypic change was not accompanied neither by increments in the total number of PGC, or periglomerular cell nuclei labeled with bromodeoxyuridine, nor by reductions in the number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), calbindin (CB) or calretinin (CR) immunoreactive PGC, we speculate that increments in the number of GABAergic PGC occur at the expense of other PGC phenotypes. In any event, these results support that adult newborn PGC phenotype may be subjected to phenotypic plasticity influenced by sensory stimulation.",

Co-localization of PrPc, Bcl-2 and Bax arose from differentiating Purkinje cells.  PrPc, together with Bcl-2 action, limited cytotoxicity during postnatal development. Programmed cell death is regulated by prototypes of a large family of Bcl-2-like proteins such as Bax and Bcl-2. A neuroprotective role for cellular prion protein (PrPc) on programmed cell death has been reported, although the cytosolic accumulation of PrPc correlates with toxicity and death of some neurons by apoptosis. In order to understand the signalling function of PrPc in promoting survival or suppressing cell death, we analyzed the expression and co-localization of PrPc, Bax and Bcl-2 proteins in the developing cerebellum of rats treated at PD10 (postnatal day 10) with the chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin (cisPt) or the new platinum (Pt) compound [Pt(O,O-acac)(-acac)(DMS)] (PtAcacDMS). Differences in the expression of PrPc, Bax and Bcl-2 were found in proliferating cells and immature Purkinje neurons. One day after administration (PD11), cisPt markedly increased the apoptosis of the proliferating cells of the EGL (external granular layer); at the same time, several apoptotic bodies with strong Bax immunoreactivity were noticed. After PtAcacDMS, changes in PrPc and apoptotic proteins, with respect to the controls, were found but Bax immunopositive apoptotic bodies were not detectable, which could mean that apoptotic cell death of proliferating cells is preserved. Co-localization was clearly detected in the Purkinje cell population and may explain better the mechanisms by which PrPc and the apoptotic proteins function, and particularly the role of PrPc. Considering the reactivity of Purkinje neurons to these proteins at PD11 and Pd17, at least PrPc expression increased after cisPt and PtAcacDMS treatments or, if PrPc decreased, balanced itself with Bcl-2. The noteworthiness of this finding is that it emphasizes that most of the post-mitotic Purkinje cells need to be rescued, otherwise they undergo degeneration and are not replaced. Based on the effects of both Pt compounds on Purkinje cell differentiation, it should be emphasized that PrPc, together with the synergistic action of the co-localized anti-apoptotic protein, acts as a neuroprotective protein countering cytotoxicity in the postnatal critical phases of cerebellum development.",

Projections to spinal dorsal horn are more likely to contact NeuN-labeled somata.  Descending afferents may underlie segmental differences in nociceptive processing. Neurons in the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) are thought to modulate nociceptive transmission via projections to spinal and trigeminal dorsal horns. The cellular substrate for this descending modulation has been studied with regard to projections to spinal dorsal horn, but studies of the projections to trigeminal dorsal horn have been less complete. In this study, we combined anterograde tracing from RVM with immunocytochemical detection of the GABAergic synthetic enzyme, GAD67, to determine if the RVM sends inhibitory projections to trigeminal dorsal horn. We also examined the neuronal targets of this projection using immunocytochemical detection of NeuN. Finally, we used electron microscopy to verify cellular targets. We compared projections to both trigeminal and spinal dorsal horns. We found that RVM projections to both trigeminal and spinal dorsal horn were directed to postsynaptic profiles in the dorsal horn, including somata and dendrites, and not to primary afferent terminals. We found that RVM projections to spinal dorsal horn were more likely to contact neuronal somata and were more likely to contain GAD67 than projections from RVM to trigeminal dorsal horn. These findings suggest that RVM neurons send predominantly GABAergic projections to spinal dorsal horn and provide direct input to postsynaptic neurons such as interneurons or ascending projection neurons. The RVM projection to trigeminal dorsal horn is more heavily targeted to dendrites and is only modestly GABAergic in nature. These anatomical features may underlie differences between trigeminal and spinal dorsal horns with regard to the degree of inhibition or facilitation evoked by RVM stimulation.",

Here, we show that TRPA1 is expressed in astrocytes in the superficial laminae of the rat trigeminal caudal nucleus by use of electron microscopic immunoperoxidase and immunogold labeling techniques. Immunoreactivity for TRPA1 was consistently observed in somata and process of astrocytes and was weaker than that in presumed nociceptive primary afferent terminals, but increased significantly in the fine process of astrocyte in rats with experimental inflammation of the temporomandibular joint.

This new form of GLAST is expressed as protein in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. GLAST (EAAT1) is an abundant glial glutamate transporter in the mammalian brain. It plays important roles in terminating excitatory transmission in grey matter, as well as pathophysiological roles, including protecting white matter from excitotoxic injury. In normal brain, alternative splicing of GLAST has been described: GLAST1a and GLAST1b arise from the splicing out of exons 3 and 9, respectively. This study describes the isolation of a novel cDNA clone from neonatal hypoxic pig brain, referred to as GLAST1c, where exons 5 and 6 are skipped. GLAST1c encodes a protein of 430 amino acids. RT-PCR analysis showed that GLAST1c mRNA was readily detectable in control and hypoxic pig cortex, as well as in various brain regions of rat (cortex, mid, hind and cerebellum), and human cortex, retina and optic nerve. We have raised antibodies that selectively recognize GLAST1c and demonstrate expression of this novel splice variant in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in rat brain, pig brain and human brain, including grey and white matter. Similarly expression of GLAST1c was observed in primary astrocyte cultures and in cultured oligodendrocytes. In unstimulated astrocytes GLAST1c exhibited an intracellular peri-nuclear distribution similar to that observed when GFP-tagged GLAST1c was transfected into COS 7 cells. In astrocytes this protein rapidly redistributed to the surface upon stimulation of protein kinase with phorbol esters.

Subsequently, when the fully kindled state was reached and then maintained for ten days, rats received a single 3-min train of VNS starting 1min prior to the kindling stimulus and lasting for 2min afterwards. In control animals the vagus nerve was not stimulated. Animals were sacrificed 48h later. The brainstems were stained for neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and Fos B.VNS decreased seizure duration with more than 25% in 21% of rats. No VNS associated changes in nNOS immunoreactivity were observed in the NTS and no changes in Fos B were observed in the NTS, PBN, or LC.

We and others have shown that the toxin leads to loss of neurons containing SP receptors and loss of GABAergic neurons in the NTS; but given that neither type neuron is thought to be integral to baroreflex transmission in NTS, mechanisms responsible for the cardiovascular changes remained unclear. Because NK1 receptors colocalize with N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors in NTS and because glutamate transmission may be integral to baroreflex transmission in the NTS we hypothesized that the toxic lesions may interrupt mechanisms for glutamate transmission.

The latter tissues were studied using water deprived (WD), salt loaded (SL), rehydrated after salt cargo and control rats by immunohistochemistry and immunoenzymatic assays. The high-performance liquid chromatography ensured the endogenous presence of the two NERPs in both plasma and hypothalamus.

PlexinA4 is expressed in the corticospinal tract.  In the DRGs, PlexinA4 is expressed in both nociceptive and proprioceptive neurons.  PlexinA4 levels decrease in femoral nerve 5 days post nerve cut. PlexinsA1A4 participate in class 3 semaphorin signaling as co-receptors to neuropilin 1 and 2, PlexinA4 being the latest member of the PlexinA subfamily to be identified. Little is known about the cellular distribution of PlexinA4 in the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglion (DRG). Here, immunohistochemical studies using antibodies to PlexinA4 revealed immunolabeling in neurons in both dorsal and, to a greater extent, ventral horns of the spinal cord. Ventral horn PlexinA4 positive neurons exhibited morphology, size, and location consistent with both motor neurons and interneurons. Labeling was found in motor axons exiting through the ventral roots, and more widespread labeling was observed in ascending and descending white matter tracts. Within the DRG, immunostaining was observed in neuronal cell bodies as well as the central and peripheral processes of these cells. PlexinA4 is expressed in the peripheral nervous system where its expression is regulated upon nerve injury. This is the first detailed description of the cellular and subcellular distribution of PlexinA4 in the adult spinal cord and DRG, and it will set the basis for future studies on the potential role of PlexinA4 in regeneration and repair of the adult central and peripheral nervous system.",

NPY Y1r labeling was detected on the majority of CaN positive cells within the BLA.  CaN labeling was primarily observed in BLA pyramidal (CaMKII positive) neurons.  Pyramidal neurons provide a cellular basis for NPY-induced CaN signaling in the BLA. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) produces potent anxiolytic effects via activation of NPY Y1 receptors (Y1r) within the basolateral amygdaloid complex (BLA). The role of NPY in the BLA was recently expanded to include the ability to produce stress resilience and long-lasting reductions in anxiety-like behavior. These persistent behavioral effects are dependent upon activity of the protein phosphatase, calcineurin (CaN), which has long been associated with shaping long-term synaptic signaling. Furthermore, NPY-induced reductions in anxiety-like behavior persist months after intra-BLA delivery, which together indicate a form of neuronal plasticity had likely occurred. To define a site of action for NPY-induced CaN signaling within the BLA, we employed multi-label immunohistochemistry to determine which cell types express CaN and if CaN colocalizes with the Y1r. We have previously reported that both major neuronal cell populations in the BLA, pyramidal projection neurons and GABAergic interneurons, express the Y1r. Therefore, this current study evaluated CaN immunoreactivity in these cell types, along with Y1r immunoreactivity. Antibodies against calcium-calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) and GABA were used to identify pyramidal neurons and GABAergic interneurons, respectively. A large population of CaN immunoreactive cells displayed Y1r immunoreactivity (90%). Nearly all (98%) pyramidal neurons displayed CaN immunoreactivity, while only a small percentage of interneurons (10%) contained CaN immunoreactivity. Overall, these anatomical findings provide a model whereby NPY could directly regulate CaN activity in the BLA via activation of the Y1r on CaN-expressing, pyramidal neurons. Importantly, they support BLA pyramidal neurons as prime targets for neuronal plasticity associated with the long-term reductions in anxiety-like behavior produced by NPY injections into the BLA.",

Galanin may be a direct link between oestradiol and GnRH neurones in the control of reproduction.  In sheep, there is no colocalization between galanin and GnRH in the POA (conversely to rodents). In rodents, the neuropeptide galanin (Gal) is involved in controlling the release of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH). In the female, this peptide is colocalized in a subpopulation of GnRH neurones and its expression is stimulated by oestradiol. In the ewe, the morphofunctional relationship between these two neuronal peptides is poorly understood. The morphological interaction between Gal and GnRH was studied in ewes treated with oestradiol or with colchicine and in control animals. Five ewes were treated for 6 h with oestradiol implants, a treatment known to induce a preovulatory surge of GnRH, and compared with five control animals. In addition, four animals received an intracerebroventricular injection of colchicine known to increase the intracellular level of galanin immunoreactivity. The morphological relationship between the two peptides was investigated by immunofluorescence using specific antibodies on the same sections, and the results were analysed using confocal microscopy. In colchicine-treated ewes, numerous Gal-immunoreactive neurones were found in the preoptic area in the vicinity of GnRH-immunoreactive neurones, but the two peptides were never observed in the same neurone. In all animals, Gal-ir fibres were observed to be in apposition to GnRH-containing perikarya in the preoptic area and these appositions were more numerous in oestradiol-treated ewes than in control animals. In contrast with rodents, galanin was not colocalized with GnRH in the neurones of the preoptic area of ewes, but this peptide could control GnRH neuronal secretion through axosomatic interactions. However, the presence of synaptic contacts between galanin terminals and GnRH perikarya needs to be confirmed by electron microscopy. As in rodents and primates, galanin could mediate the positive feedback of oestradiol on GnRH neurones during the preovulatory surge in ewes.",

CNS demyelination is associated with increased immune reactivity of the nuclear retinoid receptors RXR and RAR.  Within the demyelinating fiber tracts the increased expression of RXR protein is located in astrocytes.  Concomitant changes of other nuclear receptors suggest a participation of NR/RXR signaling in the endogenous response to white matter damage. The experimental activation of retinoid receptors reduces pathological symptoms in animal models of multiple sclerosis. In order to assess the involvement of endogenous retinoid signaling during the process of demyelination we investigated retinoic acid synthesizing enzymes and nuclear receptors using the mouse model of cuprizone toxicity. The initiation of myelin degradation in the corpus callosum was accompanied with a local increase of retinaldehyde dehydrogenase (RALDH) immunoreactivity. On the level of receptors we observed a striking increase in protein expression of the retinoid X receptor (RXR)- in the affected corpus callosum. The RXR immunoreactivity appeared exclusively in astrocytes, where it reached a maximum at five weeks of treatment, following the RALDH response. In the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia of affected mice RXR was also observed in neurons. Among nuclear receptor antigens RAR showed a cuprizone associated increase in the corpus callosum. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed strong basal expression of RXR and a significant, over 20-fold upregulation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- during demyelination. The results indicate that compensatory mechanisms during central demyelination may engage nuclear receptor dimers with an RXR partner.",

Identification of cellular co-localization sites of egr1 with tyrosine hydroxylase (dopamine) in zebrafish brain.  New double-fluorescence in situ hybridization/immunohistochemical protocol for confocal microscopy of zebrafish tissue.  Unilateral olfactory deprivation experiments show downregulation of TH/egr1 expressing cells in zebrafish olfactory bulb. Imprinting on kin occurs during the sixth day of larval development in zebrafish and depends on olfactory signals. In rodents, the immediate early gene egr1 is involved in maintaining the dopaminergic phenotype of periglomerular olfactory bulb cells in an activity dependent way. Furthermore, egr1 is upregulated in medial amygdalar dopamine cells in some rodents (prairie voles) dependent on social pheromone interactions. Thus, we aimed to investigate whether egr1 is involved in imprinting processes and later kin recognition in zebrafish in olfactory centers, such as the olfactory bulb and suspected medial amygdala. In the present paper, we focus on a basic investigation of basal egr1 expression throughout zebrafish brain development and its co-localization with tyrosine hydroxylase as a marker for dopaminergic neurons. Indeed, there is unambiguous co-localization of egr1 and tyrosine hydroxylase in the zebrafish olfactory bulb and hypothetical medial amygdala. Furthermore, as in rodents, ipsilateral transient olfactory deprivation through Triton X-100 treatment of the olfactory epithelium leads to downregulation of egr1 and tyrosine hydroxylase expression in the olfactory bulb, but apparently not in secondary olfactory targets of the zebrafish brain. This indicates that similar processes might be at work in zebrafish and rodent olfactory systems, but their more specific involvement in imprinting in zebrafish has to be further tested.",

Both species show an unusual parvocellular cluster of orexinergic neurons not seen in other mammals.  The harbour porpoise has significantly more orexinergic neurons that the giraffe, potentially related to differences in sleep patterns and diet. The present study describes the organization of the orexinergic (hypocretinergic) neurons in the hypothalamus of the giraffe and harbour porpoise  two members of the mammalian Order Cetartiodactyla which is comprised of the even-toed ungulates and the cetaceans as they share a monophyletic ancestry. Diencephalons from two sub-adult male giraffes and two adult male harbour porpoises were coronally sectioned and immunohistochemically stained for orexin-A. The staining revealed that the orexinergic neurons could be readily divided into two distinct neuronal types based on somal volume, area and length, these being the parvocellular and magnocellular orexin-A immunopositive (OxA+) groups. The magnocellular group could be further subdivided, on topological grounds, into three distinct clusters  a main cluster in the perifornical and lateral hypothalamus, a cluster associated with the zona incerta and a cluster associated with the optic tract. The parvocellular neurons were found in the medial hypothalamus, but could not be subdivided, rather they form a topologically amorphous cluster. The parvocellular cluster appears to be unique to the Cetartiodactyla as these neurons have not been described in other mammals to date, while the magnocellular nuclei appear to be homologous to similar nuclei described in other mammals. The overall size of both the parvocellular and magnocellular neurons (based on somal volume, area and length) were larger in the giraffe than the harbour porpoise, but the harbour porpoise had a higher number of both parvocellular and magnocellular orexinergic neurons than the giraffe despite both having a similar brain mass. The higher number of both parvocellular and magnocellular orexinergic neurons in the harbour porpoise may relate to the unusual sleep mechanisms in the cetaceans.",

Tcf7l2 has been suggested in the adult to function in glucose sensing in the brain.  We mapped the immunophenotypic expression of TCF7L2 protein in the developing brain of Tcf7l2 progeny.  TCF7L2 is widely expressed in the developing mouse brain and exhibits specific expression within neuronal populations and regions of the brain involved in energy balance and nutrient regulation.  It is concluded that the Tcf7l2 gene may be operative in neuromodulation of glucose within glucose sensing systems of the CNS.  As such, perturbation of Tcf7l2 may contribute to the molecular mechanisms underlying Type 2 diabetes. Genetic variants in the transcription factor 7-like 2(Tcf7l2) gene have been found to confer a significant risk of type 2 diabetes and attenuated insulin secretion. Based on its genomic wide association Tcf7l2 is considered the single most important predictor of diabetes to date. Previous studies of Tcf7l2 mRNA localization in the adult brain suggest a putative role of Tcf7l2 in the CNS regulation of energy homeostasis. The present study further characterizes the immunophenotypic distribution of peptide expression in the brains of Tcf7l2 progeny during developmental time periods between E12.5 and P1. Tcf7l2/ is lethal beyond P1. Results show that while negligible TCF7L2 expression is found in the developing brains of Tcf7l2/mice, TCF7L2 protein is relatively widespread and robustly expressed in the brain by E18.5 and exhibits specific expression within neuronal populations and regions of the brain in Tcf7l2+/ and Tcf7l2+/+ progeny. Strong immunophenotypic labeling was found in the diencephalic structure of the thalamus that suggests a role of Tcf7l2 in the development and maintenance of thalamic activity. Strongly expressed TCF7L2 was localized in select hypothalamic and preoptic nuclei indicative of Tcf7l2 function within neurons controlling energy balance. Definitive neuronal staining for TCF7L2 within nuclei of the brain stem and circumventricular organs extends TCF7L2 localization within autonomic neurons and its potential integration with autonomic function. In addition robust TCF7L2 expression was found in the tectal and tegmental structures of the superior and inferior colliculi as well as transient expression in neuroepithelium of the cerebral and hippocampal cortices of E16 and E18.5. Patterns of TCF7L2 peptide localization when compared to the adult protein synthetic chemical/anatomical landscape of glucose sensing exhibit a good correlational fit between its expression and regions, nuclei, and pathways regulating energy homeostasis via integration and response to peripheral endocrine, metabolic and neuronal signaling. TCF was also found co-localized with peptides that regulate energy homeostasis including AgRP, POMC and NPY. TCF7l2, some variants of which have been shown to impair GLP-1-induced insulin secretion, was also found co-localize with GLP-1 in adult TCF wild type progeny. Impaired Tcf7l2-mediated neural regulation may contribute to the risk and/or underlying pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes that has found high expression in genomic studies of Tcf7l2 variants.",

Fluoxetine leads to the upregulation of 14-3-3 protein in the hippocampus.  Our study is the first to demonstrate the upregulation of 14-3-3 protein in the dorsal raphe nucleus in response to fluoxetine. The serotonergic system is one of the major systems targeted in the pharmacological treatment of mood disorders including depression. Fluoxetine, one of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), has been reported to induce the expression of tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of serotonin. The 14-3-3 protein family not only activates neuronal enzymes, including TPH, but also plays a role in a wide variety of cell signaling. The aim of the present study was to determine whether fluoxetine regulates both the interaction of TPH and 14-3-3 proteins as well as the increase of those proteins in the dorsal raphe nucleus and the hippocampus. Sprague-Dawley rats were administered fluoxetine or vehicle for 5 and 14 days and sacrificed at 5 and 14 days after initial treatment. The intensity of immunoreactivity for TPH and 14-3-3 proteins in the dorsal raphe nucleus of the midbrain and in the hippocampus was measured, and the colocalization of both proteins was observed with double-labeling immunofluorescence. At 5 days after initial treatment with fluoxetine, immunoreactivity of 14-3-3 protein increased in both the dorsal raphe nucleus and the hippocampus, while that of TPH did not change in either region. In addition, at 14 days after initial treatment with fluoxetine, immunoreactivity of 14-3-3 protein significantly increased in both the dorsal raphe nucleus and hippocampus, while that of TPH showed few changes in either region. Colocalization of TPH and 14-3-3 proteins was observed in the cell bodies of dorsal raphe nucleus, whereas it was not observed in the hippocampus.

Cellular morphology is largely homogenous throughout the inferior colliculus.  Large axonal fields are a characteristic for neurons in the central nucleus. The avian inferior colliculus (IC), also referred to as the nucleus mesencephalicus lateralis pars dorsalis (MLd), is an auditory midbrain nucleus that converges auditory cues from tonotopically organized brainstem nuclei. This information is relayed onto the optic tectum on the one hand and to nucleus ovoidalis on the other hand. Morphologically, there has been considerable debate about the number and nomenclature of the subnuclei within the IC. Here, we provide morphological characteristics of single cells in five IC subnuclei in chicken.The cellular structure within the IC was studied by whole-cell patch technique and biocytin iontophoresis. In addition, histological staining was performed, to delineate the borders between subnuclei of the IC. We were able to discriminate between 5 subnuclei: the core of the central nucleus (ICCc), the medial and lateral shell of the central nucleus (ICCms and ICCls), the external nucleus (ICX) and the superficial nucleus (ICS) of the IC. Our findings suggest the existence of at least two different morphologies of neurons with two subtypes each.The IC in chicken is a largely homogenous nucleus in terms of neuronal anatomy on a cellular level. However, its compartmentation into diversified subnuclei with different neurophysiological characteristics suggests a complex system to process auditory information.

Within this species, the organization of the neural systems is almost identical to other rodent brains, even those with brains over 100 times larger.  Two aspects of the African pygmy mouse brain, the cortical cholinergic neurons and the compact locus coeruleus, align this species with other members of the Murid family to the exclusion of all other rodent species. This study investigated the nuclear organization of four immunohistochemically identifiable neural systems (cholinergic, catecholaminergic, serotonergic and orexinergic) within the brain of the African pygmy mouse (Mus minutoides). The African pygmy mice studied had a brain mass of around 275mg, making these the smallest rodent brains to date in which these neural systems have been investigated. In contrast to the assumption that in this small brain there would be fewer subdivisions of these neural systems, we found that all nuclei generally observed for these systems in other rodent brains were also present in the brain of the African pygmy mouse. As with other rodents previously studied in the subfamily Murinae, we observed the presence of cortical cholinergic neurons and a compactly organized locus coeruleus. These two features of these systems have not been observed in the non-Murinae rodents studied to date. Thus, the African pygmy mouse displays what might be considered a typical Murinae brain organization, and despite its small size, the brain does not appear to be any less complexly organized than other rodent brains, even those that are over 100 times larger such as the Cape porcupine brain. The results are consistent with the notion that changes in brain size do not affect the evolution of nuclear organization of complex neural systems.

As nonapeptides play influential roles in behavioral regulation in all vertebrates, including teleost fish, we mapped the distributions of the receptors for arginine vasotocin (AVT; homolog of arginine vasopressin) and isotocin (IST; homolog of oxytocin/mesotocin) throughout the forebrain of Astatotilapia burtoni, an African cichlid fish with behavioral phenotypes that are plastic and reversible based on the immediate social environment.

The present study represents a contribution in providing foundations for future investigations using the rock cavy as an experimental model aimed at increasing our understanding on the functional role of the serotonergic system. Serotonin, or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), is a substance found in many tissues of the body, including as a neurotransmitter in the nervous system, where it can exert different post-synaptic actions. Inside the neuro-axis, 5-HT neurons are almost entirely restricted to the raphe nuclei of the brainstem. As such, 5-HT-immunoreactivity has been considered a marker of the raphe nuclei, which are located in the brainstem, at or near the midline. The present study investigated distribution of serotonergic neurons in the brain of the rock cavy (Kerodon rupestris), a rodent species inhabiting the Brazilian Northeast. The cytoarchitectonic location of serotonergic neurons was established through a series of 5-HT immunostained sections, compared with diagrams obtained from adjacent coronal and sagittal sections stained by the Nissl method. The following nuclei were defined: the rostral group, consisting of rostral linear raphe, caudal linear raphe, median and paramedian raphe, dorsal raphe, and pontine raphe nuclei, and the caudal group composed of raphe magnus, raphe pallidus and raphe obscurus nuclei. Other serotonergic neuronal clusters, such as the supralemniscal group and the rostral and caudal ventrolateral medulla oblongata clusters, were found outside the midline. Rare 5-HT-producing neurons were identified in the lateral parabrachial nucleus and in the pontine reticular formation, mostly along fibers of the lateral lemniscus. Despite exhibiting some specializations, the picture outlined for serotonergic groups in the rock cavy brain is comparable to that described for other mammalian species.",

Pyloric sympathetic neurons contain TH, DBH, NPY, SOM, GAL.  Pyloric neurons are accompanied by VIP +, PACAP +, ChAT +, LEU +, MET +, SP +, nNOS + nerve fibers. The pylorus, an important part of the digestive tract controlling the flow of chyme between the stomach and the duodenum, is widely innervated by intrinsic and extrinsic nerves. To determine the locations of postganglionic sympathetic perikarya that innervate the pylorus of the domestic pig, a retrograde tracing method with application of Fast Blue tracer was used. All positive neuronal cell bodies (ca. 1750) were found in the celiac-cranial mesenteric ganglion complex (CSMG), however, the coeliac poles of this complex provided the major input to the pylorus. Afterwards, the immunohistochemical staining procedure was applied to determine biologically active substances expressed in the FB-labeled perikarya. Approximately 77% of the FB-positive cell bodies contained tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), 87% dopamine -hydroxylase (DH), 40% neuropeptide Y (NPY), 12% somatostatin (SOM) and 7% galanin (GAL). The presence of all these substances in the ganglion tissue was confirmed by RT-PCR technique. Double immunocytochemistry revealed that all of the TH-positive perikarya contained DH, about 40% NPY, 12% SOM and 8% GAL. Additionally, all above-cited immunohistochemical markers as well as VIP, PACAP, ChAT, LEU, MET, SP and nNOS were observed within nerve fibers associated with the FB-positive perikarya. Immunocytochemical labeling of the pyloric wall tissue disclosed that TH+, DH+ and NPY+ nerve fibers innervated ganglia of the myenteric and submucosal plexuses, blood vessels, both muscular layers and the muscularis mucosae; nerve fibers immunoreactive to GAL mostly innervated both muscular layers, while SOM+ nerve fibers were observed within the myenteric plexus.

Oxidative stress markers including malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione, in cerebellum were determined.  The neuroprotective mechanism was discussed in the view of antioxidative system.  Chlorogenic acid could be beneficial for prevention from the side-effects of chemotherapeutics. Several studies have well confirmed the contribution of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of methotrexate (MTX)-induced damage in the various organs. Many agents have been tested experimentally to reduce or inhibit the oxidative stress. The aim of this study was to determine the possible protective effect of chlorogenic acid (CLG) on MTX-induced cerebellar damage in rats. The rats were randomly divided into three groups as follows: I: control group; II: MTX group; III: CLG + MTX group. In the MTX group; malondialdehyde (MDA) content was found to be increased, whereas superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) activities, and glutathione (GSH) content were decreased. On the other hand, CLG markedly attenuated the elevated MDA content and prevented the deleterious effects of MTX on oxidative stress markers. MTX caused severe loss of Purkinje cells and apoptotic cell death in the cerebellum. The CLG administration before MTX treatment significantly reduced Purkinje cell damage and the expression of apoptotic cells. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that chlorogenic acid treatment may protect the impairment of oxidative stress and ameliorate MTX-induced cerebellar damage at biochemical and histological levels.",

In addition, we analysed in the pineal the daynight expression (using quantitative real-time PCR) of two key enzymes in the melatonin-synthesising pathway; arylalkylamine- N-acetyltransferase 2 (AANAT2) and hydroxyindole- O-methyltransferase (HIOMT). The pineal complex of sea bass consisted of a narrow and short pineal stalk that adopts a vertical disposition, a small-sized pineal end vesicle firmly attached to the skull by connective tissue, a parapineal organ and a convoluted dorsal sac. Immunohistochemical study showed the presence of abundant serotonin-positive cells. Cone opsin-like and rod opsin-like photoreceptor cells were also evidenced in the pineal stalk and vesicle. Both Aanat2 and Hiomt were expressed in sea bass pineal organ. Aanat2 exhibited higher nocturnal transcript levels, while no significant daynight differences were found for Hiomt.

Many effects of progesterone are mediated by a nuclear progesterone receptor (PR), which is crucial for integration of external signals and internal physiological cues in the brain to produce an appropriate behavioral output. The tungara frog, Physalaemus pustulosus, is an excellent model system for the study of mechanisms by which sensory signals, such as auditory communication, are processed within neural circuits where mate choice decisions are made. To establish a framework for studying the neural basis of mate choice and social behavior in this species, we first describe the cytoarchitecture of the brain using Nissl-stained sections. Then, in order to better understand where progesterone acts to regulate social decisions, we determined the distribution of PR protein throughout the brain of P. pustulosus by immunohistochemistry. We found PR immunoreactivity in key brain regions known to modulate the processing of auditory cues and social behavior in other vertebrates. Due to its widespread distribution, PR likely also plays important roles in non-limbic brain regions that mediate non-social information processing. Further, we have colocalized PR with tyrosine hydroxylase, providing a functional context for the role of progesterone in mediating motivation and motor behavior. Our results significantly extend our understanding of hormonal modulation in the anuran brain and support the important role of the nuclear progesterone receptor in modulating female mate choice and receptivity in amphibians and across vertebrates.",

There are potential links between the elevation of PKC and the age-related hearing loss in C57 mice and BALB/c mice.  The neuroplasticity in PKC at mRNA and protein levels in the CN might be associated with the Ca 2+ related neuronal degeneration.  The changes in PKC suggest that it could provide insights into protection and therapy of auditory degeneration. Age-dependent alteration in cellular signaling is implicated in the onset of age-related hearing loss (presbycusis). The gamma subtype of protein kinase C (PKC) is a PKC isoenzyme exclusively expressed in central nervous system but its potential role in the presbycusis remains unclear. Using two presbycusis-like animal models (C57BL/6J strain and BALB/c strain), the auditory thresholds were assessed by auditory brainstem response (ABR) in young (2-month-old), adult (8-month-old) and old (24-month-old) groups, and the localization and expression of PKC in the cochlear nucleus (CN) was examined by immunohistochemistry, Western blotting and Real-Time PCR. The results showed that PKC immmunoreactive (-ir) neurons were mainly concentrated in the molecular layer and fusiform layer of the dorsal CN (DCN) and their number was increased significantly with aging ( p < 0.05). Moreover, compared with 2-month-old mice, PKC expression in the CN at both protein and mRNA levels was significantly increased in the 8-month-old mice and 24-month-old mice ( p < 0.05). Thus our findings demonstrate a potential link between the increased PKC expression and the age-related hearing loss in these mice, suggesting novel strategies for the prevention and therapy of age-associated auditory disorders.",

Chronic constriction injury of sciatic nerve is a closer model of clinical human neuropathic pain than previously appreciated.  Rats with pain and disability after injury show the molecular and anatomical hall marks of cell death in discrete regions of the periaqueductal grey of the midbrain.  These periaqueductal grey regions are pivotal for the expression of normal social and sleep-wake behaviours.  Nerve injury triggered cell death in the periaqueductal grey may underlie some of the disabilities which characterise chronic neuropathic pain states. Complex behavioural disabilities, as well as pain, characterise neuropathic pain conditions for which clinical treatment is sought. In rats, chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve evokes, allodynia and hyperalgesia as well as three distinct patterns of disability, characterised by changes in social and sleep-wake behaviours: (i) Pain & Disability; (ii) Pain & Transient Disability and (iii) Pain alone. Importantly, the degree of allodynia and hyperalgesia is identical for each of these groups. Social-interactions and sleep-wake behaviours are regulated by neural networks, which converge on the periaqueductal grey (PAG). Rats with Pain & Disability show astrocyte activation restricted to the lateral and ventrolateral PAG. Reactive astrocytes are a hallmark of cell death (apoptosis and necrosis). Quantitative real-time RT-PCR for the mRNAs encoding Bax, Bcl-2, heat shock protein 60 (HSP60), mitogen activated kinase kinase (MEK2) and iNOS was performed on the dorsal midbrains of individual, disability characterised rats, extending our earlier Gene-Chip data, showing a select up-regulation of Bax and MEK2 mRNA, and a down-regulation of HSP60 mRNA, in Pain & Disability rats. The anatomical location of TUNEL and cleaved-caspase-3 immunoreactive profiles in the midbrain was also identified. Rats with Pain & Disability showed: (i) pro-apoptotic ratios of Bax:Bcl-2 mRNAs; (ii) decreased HSP60 mRNA; (iii) increased iNOS and MEK2 mRNAs; (iv) TUNEL-positive profiles in the lateral and ventrolateral PAG; and (v) caspase-3 immunoreactive neurons in the mesencephalic nucleus of the trigeminal nerve.

This review paper summarizes our previous contributions to the study of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) innervation of basal ganglia in human and nonhuman primates under normal conditions. We have visualized the 5-HT neuronal system in squirrel monkey ( Saimiri sciureus) and human postmortem materials with antibodies directed against either 5-HT, 5-HT transporter (SERT) or 5-HT synthesizing enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH). Confocal microscopy was used to compare the distribution of 5-HT and dopamine (DA; tyrosine hydroxylase-immunolabeled) axons in human, while the ultrastructural features of 5-HT axon terminals in monkey subthalamic nucleus were characterized at electron microscopic level. In monkeys and humans, midbrain raphe neurons emit axons that traverse the brainstem via the transtegmental system, ascend within the medial forebrain bundle and reach their targets by coursing along the major output pathways of the basal ganglia. These 5-HT axons arborize in virtually all basal ganglia components with the substantia nigra receiving the densest innervation and the striatum the most heterogeneous one. Although the striatum  the major basal ganglia input structure  appears to be a common termination site for many of 5-HT ascending axons, our results reveal that the widely distributed 5-HT neuronal system can also act directly upon neurons located within the two major output structures of the basal ganglia, namely the internal pallidum and the substantia nigra pars reticulata in monkeys and humans. This system also has a direct access to neurons of the DA nigrostriatal pathway, a finding that underlines the importance of the 5-HT/DA interactions in the physiopathology of basal ganglia.",

Selective increase of cChAT positive fibers in the nucleus accumbens shell and in the central nucleus of the amygdala after an acute injection of heroin to drug naive rats. Reduction of calretinin immune-reactive cells in the dentate gyrus of heroin sensitized rats.  Discussion highlights: link between cholinergic system and drug dependence; evidence that different areas of the brain are involved in the different stages of addiction. Previous studies suggest that behavioral consequences of heroin treatment depend on the drug history of the animals and that cholinergic neurotransmission is involved in both behavioral and motor sensitization induced by heroin and other drugs of abuse. Immunohistochemistry, using a recently developed antiserum, specific for choline acetyl-transferase of the common type (cChAT), was applied to four different groups of rats, differing in drug regimens. Two groups of rats were submitted to the same schedule of heroin sensitization and then challenged for vehicle or heroin before sacrifice, obtaining two distinct groups, namely heroin-vehicle (HV) and heroin-heroin (HH). The same challenge was applied to another group of rats, previously submitted to a treatment with vehicle, obtaining other two groups, vehicle-vehicle (VV) and vehicle-heroin (VH), respectively. The number of cChAT-positive neurons is significantly increased ( p < 0.05) in the diagonal band nuclei (with a consequent increase of cChAT positive fibers in the dentate gyrus) and notably, even not significantly ( p > 0.05), increased in the nucleus accumbens core of heroin-sensitized rats (HV, HH). Instead, acute heroin treatment significantly increase ( p < 0.05) the number of cChAT-positive cells in the nucleus accumbens shell of both heroin-naive (VH) and heroin-sensitized (HH) rats. In heroin-sensitized rats (HV, HH), moreover, staining intensity of cChAT-positive fibers is significantly increased in the dorsal striatum, and basolateral amygdala ( p < 0.05). Unlikely, cChAT positive fibers in the central amygdala are significantly increased ( p < 0.05) by acute heroin treatments (VH, HH). The increase of cholinergic fibers in the dentate gyrus of the heroin sensitized rats (HV, HH) seems accompanied by a evident reduction in calretinin immunoreactive neurons in the same area.

Depression and anxiety are among the leading causes of societal burden. Abnormalities in 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; serotonin) neurotransmission are known to be associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms. The rostral projections of brainstem dorsal (DRN) and median (MRN) raphe nuclei are the main sources of forebrain 5-HT. The expression, turnover and distribution of tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2), the rate-limiting enzyme in 5-HT biosynthesis in the DRN and MRN are complex, in keeping with the existence of different subpopulations of 5-HT neurons in this area. In the present study, we measured the expression of TPH2 mRNA in the DRN and MRN using in situ hybridization in three genetically modified mouse models, all relevant to depression and anxiety, and matched wild-type controls. Our results show quantitative modifications in TPH2 mRNA expression in the three main subregions of the DRN as well as the MRN in relation to changes in serotonergic, glutamatergic and endocannabinoid neurotransmission systems. Thus, there were significant decreases in TPH2 transcript levels in 5-HT transporter (5-HTT)/ mutant mice, whereas increases were observed in the vesicular glutamate transporter 1 hemi knock out (VGLUT1+/) and cannabinoid receptor 1 mutant (CB1R/) mice.

Relaxin-3 is expressed in brainstem GABA neurons that project broadly to forebrain.  Relaxin-3 neural network is hypothesised to represent an ascending arousal system.  Relaxin-3/RXFP3 signalling has putative roles in arousal, stress, mood and memory. The relaxin-3 gene was identified in 2001 by searching the human genome database for homologues of the relaxin hormone, and was subsequently discovered to encode a highly conserved neuropeptide in mammals and lower species. In the decade since its discovery there have been significant advances in our knowledge of the peptide, including the identification of its cognate receptor (a type 1 G-protein coupled receptor, GPCR135 or RXFP3), an understanding of its structureactivity and associated cellular signalling, and the elucidation of key neuroanatomical aspects of relaxin-3/RXFP3 networks in mammalian brain. The latter studies revealed that relaxin-3 is expressed within GABA neurons of the brainstem including an area known as the nucleus incertus, and that ascending relaxin-3 projections innervate a broad range of RXFP3-rich forebrain areas. These maps provided a foundation for pharmacological and physiological studies to elucidate the neurobiological nature of relaxin-3/RXFP3 signalling in vivo. Recent findings from our laboratory and others suggest the relaxin-3 neural network represents a newly identified ascending arousal system, able to modulate a range of interrelated functions including responses to stress, spatial and emotional memory, feeding and metabolism, motivation and reward, and circadian rhythm and sleep/wake states. More research is now required to discover further important facts about relaxin-3 neurons, such as their various regulatory inputs, and to characterise populations of RXFP3-positive neurons and determine their influence on particular neural circuits, physiology and complex behaviour.",

        "des": "Highlights  Neuropeptides are a wide group of small proteins produced by neurons.  Neuropeptides coexist in neurons with low-molecular-weight neurotransmitter.  The selective storage of neuropeptides in dense core vesicles allows for their specific release.  Neuropeptides act as modulators of fast neurotransmission. Neuropeptides are small protein molecules produced and released by discrete cell populations of the central and peripheral nervous systems through the regulated secretory pathway and acting on neural substrates. Inside the nerve cells, neuropeptides are selectively stored within large granular vesicles (LGVs), and commonly coexist in neurons with low-molecular-weight neurotransmitters (acetylcholine, amino acids, and catecholamines). Storage in LGVs is responsible for a relatively slow response to secretion that requires enhanced or repeated stimulation. Coexistence (i.e. the concurrent presence of a neuropeptide with other messenger molecules in individual neurons), and co-storage (i.e. the localization of two or more neuropeptides within individual LGVs in neurons) give rise to a complicated series of pre- and post-synaptic functional interactions with low-molecular-weight neurotransmitters. The typically slow response and action of neuropeptides as compared to fast-neurotransmitters such as excitatory/inhibitory amino acids and catecholamines is also due to the type of receptors that trigger neuropeptide actions onto target cells. Almost all neuropeptides act on G-protein coupled receptors that, upon ligand binding, activate an intracellular cascade of molecular enzymatic events, eventually leading to cellular responses. The latter occur in a time span (seconds or more) considerably longer (milliseconds) than that of low-molecular-weight fast-neurotransmitters, directly operating through ion channel receptors. As reviewed here, combined immunocytochemical visualization of neuropeptides and their receptors at the ultrastructural level and electrophysiological studies, have been fundamental to better unravel the role of neuropeptides in neuron-to-neuron communication.",

All physiologically identified, peripheral cholinergic neurons express pChAT.  pChAT appears ubiquitously distributed in various phyla of the animal kingdom.  DRG sensory neurons express pChAT which synthesizes ACh.  pChAT may play role in presynaptic inhibition and axon reflex vasodilation. The peripheral type of choline acetyltransferase (pChAT) is an isoform of the well-studied common type of choline acetyltransferase (cChAT), the synthesizing enzyme of acetylcholine. Since pChAT arises by exons skipping, its amino acid sequence is similar to that of cChAT, except the lack of a continuous peptide sequence encoded by all the four exons from 6 to 9. While cChAT expression has been observed in both the central and peripheral nervous systems, pChAT is preferentially expressed in the peripheral nervous system. pChAT appears to be a reliable marker for the visualization of peripheral cholinergic neurons and their processes, whereas other conventional markers including cChAT have not been used successfully for it. In mammals like rodents, pChAT immunoreactivity has been observed in most, if not all, physiologically identified peripheral cholinergic structures such as all parasympathetic postganglionic neurons and most neurons of the enteric nervous system. In addition, pChAT has been found in many peripheral neurons that are derived from the neural crest. These include sensory neurons of the trigeminal ganglion and the dorsal root ganglion, and sympathetic postganglionic neurons. Recent studies moreover indicate that pChAT, as well as cChAT, appears ubiquitously expressed among various species not only of vertebrate mammals but also of invertebrate mollusks. This finding implies that the alternative splicing mechanism to generate pChAT and cChAT has been preserved during evolution, probably for some functional benefits.",

GABAergic interneurones, including those within spinal dorsal horn, contain one of the two isoforms of the synthesizing enzyme glutamate decarboxylase (GAD), either GAD65 or GAD67. The physiological significance of these two GABAergic phenotypes is unknown but a more detailed anatomical and functional characterization may help resolve this issue. In this study, two transgenic Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) knock-in murine lines, namely GAD65-GFP and GAD67-GFP (neo) mice, were used to profile expression of Shaw-related Kv3.1b and Kv3.3 K+-channel subunits in dorsal horn interneurones. Neuronal expression of these subunits confers specific biophysical characteristic referred to as fast-spiking.

Co-expression was also detected for GAD67-GFP +ve neurones and capsaicin-induced c-fos but at a much reduced level of 45%.

The region had distinct properties on histochemistry and neuronal connection.  Parcellation of the posterior thalamus should be revised on the present findings. The posterior thalamus (Po) consists of heterogeneous groups of cells, which have not been clearly defined. In the present study, we focused on a part of the Po in the mouse brain, which is located caudally to the ventral posterior nucleus and rostromedially to the medial geniculate nucleus and shows distinct calretinin immunoreactivity. While we found the region had a considerable unity on the cytoarchitectural and histochemical grounds, it did not correspond to any particular nucleus but partially involved three structures in a widely used brain atlas ( Franklin and Paxinos, 2008). Therefore, we tentatively designated the region as the medioventral part of the posterior thalamus (PoMV) and examined its anatomical features with immunohistochemistry and retrograde tract-tracing. The PoMV was appreciated as a reticular structure with prominent calretinin immunoreactivity, especially in horizontal sections, and displayed apparent differences in the cytoarchitecture from its surrounding regions. The PoMV had two divisions: the dorsal division (PoMVd), which contained parvalbuminimmunoreactive fibers, and the ventral division (PoMVv), which lacked these fibers. The tract-tracing studies showed that the somata retrogradely labeled from the injections in the insular cortex and some of the extended amygdalar regions were fairly concentrated within the PoMV, especially in the PoMVd. On the other hand, the labeling from the medial hypothalamus injections was found predominantly within the PoMVv. These findings indicate that the PoMV can be regarded as a distinct structure within the Po, and it may play a role in the emotional aspect of somatosensory processing.",

Circumventricular organs such as the median eminence and area postrema are labeled. Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-3/Flt4 binds VEGF-C and VEGF-D with high affinity. It has been suggested to be involved in neurogenesis and adult neuronal function. However, little is known about the localization of VEGFR-3 in the adult central nervous system (CNS). The present study presents, to our knowledge, the first detailed mapping of VEGFR-3 mRNA expression in adult rat brain and spinal cord by using in situ hybridization and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis (RT-PCR). Varying VEGFR-3 expression intensity was detected in functionally diverse nuclei, with the highest levels in the mitral cells of the olfactory bulb, piriform cortex, anterodorsal thalamic nucleus, several nuclei of the hypothalamus, and the brainstem cranial nerve nuclei. VEGFR-3 mRNA was abundantly expressed in the ventral motor neurons of the spinal cord and in some circumventricular organs such as the median eminence and the area postrema. Moreover, the locus coeruleus and some of the nuclei of the reticular formation showed moderate-to-high hybridization signals. VEGFR-3 expression appeared to be localized mostly within neurons, but weak labeling was also found in some astrocytes. In particular, VEGFR-3 was highly expressed in ependymal cells of the ventral third ventricle and the median eminence, which were co-labeled with vimentin but not with glial fibrillary acidic protein, suggesting that these cells are tanycytes. RT-PCR analysis revealed similar levels of VEGFR-3 expression in all regions of the adult rat CNS.

In the present review article, possible neural function of neuropsin, a serine protease, was focused, and importance in early phase of LTP was descried.  The involvement of neuropsin in the single synaptic function leads to relate to synaptic late association between two independent hippocampal synapses.  This hypothetical synaptic associations may be related to mammalian working memory and consequently integration in learning and memory. Accumulating evidence has suggested pivotal roles for neural proteases in development, maturation, aging, and cognitive functions. Among such proteases, neuropsin, a kallikrein gene-related (KLK) endoprotease, appears to have a significant plasticity function that has been analyzed primarily in the hippocampal Schaffer-collateral pathway. In this article, after reviewing the general features of neuropsin, its role in Schaffer-collateral synaptic plasticity is discussed in some detail. Enzymatically active neuropsin is necessary to establish the early phase of long-term potentiation (LTP). This type of LTP, which can be elicited by rather weak tetanic stimulation, is significant in synaptic late association between two independent hippocampal synapses. Neuropsin deficiency completely impaired the early phase of LTP, leading to the absence of late associativity.

Instead, we detailed distributions of cells containing these molecules in the medial amygdala, caudal preoptic area and caudal bed nuclei of the stria terminalis (BST) and quantified their densities in the PdPN, MPNm and lateral MeApd for comparison to densities previously assessed for mating-activated efferents from these sites.

Overall, activation of these autoreceptors is rewarding and anxiolytic, but has more complex effects in models of helplessness.  Both stress and antidepressant treatment appear to desensitize these autoreceptors. Neurotransmission by serotonin (5-HT) is tightly regulated by several autoreceptors that fine-tune serotonergic neurotransmission through negative feedback inhibition at the cell bodies (predominantly 5-HT 1A) or at the axon terminals (predominantly 5-HT 1B); however, more subtle roles for 5-HT 1D and 5-HT 2B autoreceptors have also been detected. This review provides an overview of 5-HT autoreceptors, focusing on their contribution in animal behavioral models of stress and emotion. Experiments targeting 5-HT autoreceptors in awake, behaving animals have generally shown that increasing autoreceptor feedback is anxiolytic and rewarding, while enhanced 5-HT function is aversive and anxiogenic; however, the role of serotonergic activity in behavioral models of helplessness is more complex. The prevailing model suggests that 5-HT autoreceptors become desensitized in response to stress exposure and antidepressant administration, two seemingly opposite manipulations. Thus there are still unresolved questions regarding the role of these receptorsand serotonin in generalin normal and pathological states.",

This process is regulated at different steps: cell proliferation, migration and integration.  Neurotransmitters act in a complex network to regulate these adult neurogenic processes. Adult neurogenesis is due to the persistence of pools of constitutive stem cells able to give rise to a progeny of proliferating progenitors. In rodents, adult neurogenic niches have been found in the subventricular zone (SVZ) along the lateral ventricles and in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus in the hippocampus. SVZ progenitors undergo a unique process of tangential migration from the lateral ventricle to the olfactory bulb (OB) where they differentiate mainly into GABAergic interneurons in the granule and glomerular layers. SVZ progenitor proliferation, migration and differentiation into fully integrated neurons, are strictly related processes regulated by complex interactions between cell intrinsic and extrinsic influences. Numerous observations demonstrate that neurotrasmitters are involved in all steps of the adult neurogenic process, but the understanding of their role is hampered by their intricate mechanism of action and by the highly complex network in which neurotransmitters work.

PINK1 is localized in both neuronal and glial cells. PINK1 is a 581 amino acid protein with a serine/threonine kinase domain and an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting motif. The enzyme is expressed in the brain as well as in several tissues such as heart, skeletal muscle, liver, kidney, pancreas and testis. In the present study, we have investigated by Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry the presence and distribution of PINK1 in the brain, eye and inner ear of mouse during embryonic development. In the brain we detected two PINK1 molecular isoforms of 55 kDa and 66 kDa. Immunoreactive perikarya first appeared at stage E15 in the diencephalon within the thalamus, the hypothalamus, the periventricular layers of the third ventricle and in the rhombencephalon at level of the pons. Subsequently, new PINK1-positive neurons were found in the midbrain within the floor and the periventricular layers of the ventral wall of the mesencephalic vesicle (stage E17) as well as in the neopallial cortex, the tegmentum of the midbrain and the periventricular region of the caudal part of the rhombencephalon (stage E19). At P0, PINK1-immunoreactive cells appeared in the striatum, the mantle layer and caudal part of the medulla oblongata and the cerebellum.

TH density in mesolimbic and social brain areas related to affiliative behaviors.  Behavior/TH correlations for Ac and ventral tegmental area were subregion specific.  Affiliative behavior was similar in same- and mixed-sex zebra finch pairs. The catecholamines dopamine and norepinephrine are implicated in affiliative behaviors, yet few studies have addressed the extent to which affiliative behaviors within distinct social settings rely upon similar or distinct catecholaminergic mechanisms. To explore the role of catecholamines in affiliative behavior within distinct long-term social contexts, we examined the density of the catecholamine synthetic enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in brain regions within both the mesolimbic dopaminergic system and social behavior network in male and female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) paired for 21 days with either a same- or opposite-sex conspecific. On days 1621 after pairing, members of both same- and mixed-sex pairs produced similar rates of affiliative behaviors. Measures of affiliation related to TH labeling in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), nucleus accumbens (Ac), medial preoptic nucleus (POM), and ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH). Relationships between TH labeling density and specific measures of affiliative behavior differed in rostral compared to caudal subregions of Ac and VTA, suggesting distinct roles for these subregions in the regulation of affiliative behavior. Finally, TH labeling density in the VMH and rostral VTA were positively related to the amount of courtship received from the partner and TH labeling in Ac was denser in opposite-sex pairs compared to same-sex pairs, indicative of socially induced brain plasticity. Overall, results highlight a complex region- and behavior-specific role for catecholamines in vertebrate affiliation.",

Array profiles largely agreed with a prior study of combined white and gray matter.  Unique gray-matter AD changes included ryanodine and vascular pathways.  Unique white-matter AD changes included epigenetic and transcriptional pathways. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder that threatens to reach epidemic proportions as our population ages. Although much research has examined molecular pathways associated with AD, relatively few such studies have focused on the disease's critical early stages. In a prior microarray study we correlated gene expression in hippocampus with degree of Alzheimer's disease and found close associations between upregulation of apparent glial transcription factor/epigenetic/tumor suppressor genes and incipient AD. The results suggested a new model in which AD pathology spreads along myelinated axons ( Blalock et al., 2004). However, the microarray analyses were performed on RNA extracted from frozen hand-dissected hippocampal CA1 tissue blocks containing both gray and white matter, limiting the confidence with which transcriptional changes in gray matter could be distinguished from those in white matter. Here, we used laser capture microdissection (LCM) to exclude major white matter tracts while selectively collecting CA1 hippocampal gray matter from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) hippocampal sections of the same subjects assessed in our prior study. Microarray analyses of this gray matter-enriched tissue revealed many transcriptional changes similar to those seen in our past study and in studies by others, particularly for downregulated neuron-related genes. Additionally, the present analyses identified several previously undetected pathway alterations, including downregulation of molecules that stabilize ryanodine receptor Ca2+ release and upregulation of vasculature development. Conversely, we found a striking paucity of the upregulated changes in the putative glial and growth-related genes that had been strongly overrepresented in the prior mixed-tissue study. We conclude that FFPE tissue can be a reliable resource for microarray studies of brain tissue, that upregulation of growth-related epigenetic/transcription factors during incipient AD is predominantly localized in and around white matter (supporting our prior findings and model), and that novel alterations in vascular and ryanodine receptor-related pathways in gray matter are closely associated with incipient AD.",

Recent evidence points toward a role of miRNAs in synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis, phenomena believed to be associated with stress-related disorders, including major depression.  A direct role of miRNAs in the etiology of depression is emerging as the expression of miRNAs is altered in the brain of stressed and behaviorally depressed animals as well as in depressed patients.  This review article aims to describe the recent evidence that demonstrates that miRNAs may play a critical role in the etiology of major depression. Major depression is a debilitating disease. Despite a tremendous amount of research, the molecular mechanisms associated with the etiopathology of major depression are not clearly understood. Several lines of evidence indicate that depression is associated with altered neuronal and structural plasticity and neurogenesis. MicroRNAs are a newly discovered prominent class of gene expression regulators that have critical roles in neural development, are needed for survival and optimal health of postmitotic neurons, and regulate synaptic functions, particularly by regulating protein synthesis in dendritic spines. In addition, microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate both embryonic and adult neurogenesis. Given that miRNAs are involved in neural plasticity and neurogenesis, the concept that miRNAs may play an important role in psychiatric illnesses, including major depression, is rapidly advancing. Emerging evidence demonstrates that the expression of miRNAs is altered during stress, in the brain of behaviorally depressed animals, and in human postmortem brain of depressed subjects. In this review article, the possibility that dysregulation of miRNAs and/or altered miRNA response may contribute to the etiology and pathophysiology of depressive disorder is discussed.",

The pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) may be a potential target for severe freezing and postural instability with 25 Hz stimulation being considered more effective than 130 Hz stimulation. Here we evaluated the expression of c-Fos after 25 Hz and 130 Hz DBS of the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTg, i.e., the rodent equivalent to the human PPN) in the rat 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) PD model. Anaesthetized male Sprague Dawley rats with unilateral 6-OHDA-induced nigrostriatal lesions were stimulated with 25 Hz, 130 Hz, or 0 Hz sham-stimulation for 4 h by electrodes implanted into the ipsilateral PPTg. Thereafter the distribution and number of neurons expressing the immediate early gene c-Fos, a marker for acute neuronal activity, was assessed. DBS of the PPTg induced strong ipsilateral c-Fos expression at the stimulation site, with 25 Hz having a more marked impact than 130 Hz. Additionally, c-Fos was strongly expressed in the central gray. In the dorsal part expression was stronger after 25 Hz stimulation, while in the medial and ventral part there was no difference between 25 Hz and 130 Hz stimulation. Expression in the basal ganglia was negligible.

This close anatomical relationship suggests an important functional role for 5-HT in influencing cell proliferation in the SVZ.  Evidence suggest a fine-tuning effect of 5-HT on cell proliferation, enhanced by lower concentrations and decreased by higher levels. Although many studies have appeared on the mechanisms of neurogenesis in the adult mammalian central nervous system, the challenge remains to identify the factors controlling this process. Among numerous factors, which have been described to influence neurogenesis, serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) has received considerable attention. 5-HT drug manipulations and their effects on neurogenesis have revealed that 5-HT contributes to adult neurogenesis. An interesting but relatively unexplored detail is the presence of an extensive plexus of 5-HT containing fibers in the subventricular zone, the main neurogenic brain structure besides the dentate gyrus in the hippocampal formation. A dense plexus of 5-HT fibers surrounds the subventricular zone, separating this region from the adjacent structures of the lateral ventricle. This close anatomical relationship suggests an important functional role for 5-HT in influencing cell proliferation in the subventricular zone. Here, we review the literature and propose that subependymal plexus is part of an intrinsic brain mechanism which controls the subventricular zone cell proliferative capacity by modulating 5-HT release.",

PFK and PK activities in the brain during hypoxic exposures undergo hypometabolic changes.  Complex I activity in the brain during hypoxic exposures is decreased.  ATP levels and energy charge is preserved in hypoxic exposures.  Brain structures are protected in hypoxic exposures. The key for an animal to survive prolonged hypoxia is to avoid rapid decline in ATP levels in vital organs such as the brain. This can be well achieved by a very few of hypoxia-tolerant animals such as freshwater turtles and newborn animals, since these animals can substantially suppress their metabolic levels by coordinated regulation of ATP-producing and ATP-demanding pathways. However, most animals, especially adult mammals, can only tolerate a short period of hypoxia since they are unable to maintain constant ATP levels and energy charge in vital organs during prolonged hypoxic exposure. Here, we described a special mouse model, in which a hypoxia intolerant adult mouse gradually built up an ability to survive prolonged hypoxia after intermittent hypoxic exposures. This increased ability was accompanied by reductions in body temperature and O2 consumption as well as transient variations in blood pCO2, pO2 and pH. The glucose and energy metabolism in the brain of the mouse altered similarly to those reported in the brain of hypoxic turtles. Activities of phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase, the two rate-limiting enzymes controlling the rate of glycolysis decreased to baseline levels after a short period of increase. In contrast, the activity of complex I, the major enzyme complex controlling oxidative phosphorylation, was kept inhibited. These alterations in the ATP-producing pathway suggest the occurrence of reverse Pasteur effect, indicating that the animal had entered a hypometabolic state favoring maintenance of ATP level and energy charge in hypoxic conditions. In supporting this idea, the ATP levels and energy charge as well as neuronal structures in the brain were well preserved. This study provides evidence for a possibility that a hypoxic intolerant animal can build up an ability to survive prolonged hypoxia through regulation of its glucose and energy metabolism after an appropriate hypoxic training, which deserves further investigation.",

We have examined the histogenesis of the olfactory system during turbot development using histological and immunohistochemical methods. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immunohistochemistry was used to detect dividing cells, whereas calretinin (CR) immunohistochemistry was used to distinguish some neuronal components of the olfactory system. Around hatching, the olfactory placode of embryos transforms into an olfactory pit, which enlarges progressively during development.

The present study was to examine the distribution of transient receptor potential vanilloid type-1 (TRPV1) receptor immunoreactivity in the acupuncture points (acupoint), and determine the influences of electroacupuncture (EA) stimulation on TRPV1 expression. EA stimulation of BL 40 was conducted in two sessions of 20 min separated by an 80 min interval in anesthetized rats. Sections of skin containing BL 40, and its non-meridian control were examined by immunolabeling with antibodies directed against TRPV1. Without EA, the number of subepidermal nerve fibers expressing TRPV1 was higher in the acupoint than in non-acupoint control skin ( p < 0.01). The subepidermal nerve fibers showed the co-localization of TRPV1 with peripherine, a marker for the C-fibers and A- fibers. The expression of TRPV1 in nerve fibers is significantly increased by EA stimulation in acupoints ( p < 0.01). However the upregulation in the non acupoint meridian and the non-meridian control skin was short of statistical significance. Double immunostaining of TRPV1 and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) revealed their co-localization in both the subepidermal nerve fibers and in the dermal connective tissue cells. These results show that a high expression of TRPV1 endowed with nNOS in subepidermal nerve fibers exists in the acupoints and the expression is increased by EA. We conclude that the higher expression of TRPV1 in the subepidermal nerve fibers and its upregulation after EA stimulation may play a key role in mediating the transduction of EA signals to the CNS, and its expression in the subepidermal connective tissue cells may play a role in conducting the local effect of the EA.",

CGRP-positive nociceptors express vitamin D metabolizing enzymes CYP27B1 and CYP24.  Ovariectomy reduces cytoplasmic VDR and CYP27B1, but not CYP24 in CGRP-positive nociceptors.  Ovariectomy likely reduces vitamin D signaling by reducing ligand and receptors concentrations. Vitamin D insufficiency impacts sensory processes including pain and proprioception, but little is known regarding vitamin D signaling in adult sensory neurons. We analyzed female rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG) for vitamin receptor (VDR) and the vitamin D metabolizing enzymes CYP27B1 and CYP24. Western blots and immunofluorescence revealed the presence of these proteins in sensory neurons. Nuclear VDR immunoreactivity was present within nearly all neurons, while cytoplasmic VDR was found preferentially in unmyelinated calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-positive neurons, colocalizing with CYP27B1 and CYP24. These data suggest that 1,25(OH) 2D3 may affect sensory neurons through nuclear or extranuclear signaling pathways. In addition, local vitamin D metabolite concentrations in unmyelinated sensory neurons may be controlled through expression of CYP27B1 and CYP24. Because vitamin D deficiency appears to exacerbate some peri-menopausal pain syndromes, we assessed the effect of ovariectomy on vitamin D-related proteins. Two weeks following ovariectomy, total VDR expression in DRG dropped significantly, owing to a slight decrease in the percentage of total neurons expressing nuclear VDR and a large drop in unmyelinated CGRP-positive neurons expressing cytoplasmic VDR. Total CYP27B1 expression dropped significantly, predominantly due to decreased expression within unmyelinated CGRP-positive neurons. CYP24 expression remained unchanged. Therefore, unmyelinated CGRP-positive neurons appear to have a distinct vitamin D phenotype with hormonally-regulated ligand and receptor levels. These findings imply that vitamin D signaling may play a specialized role in a neural cell population that is primarily nociceptive.",

Glutamate-axons arising from different brain areas heavily express one of three types of vesicular glutamate transporter: VGLUT1, VGLUT2 or VGLUT3.  We discuss how these glutamate excitatory inputs may regulate DR circuits and their implications in emotional processing. The dorsal raphe nucleus (DR) contains the majority of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) neurons in the brain that regulate neural activity in forebrain regions through their widespread projections. DR function is linked to stress and emotional processing, and is implicated in the pathophysiology of affective disorders. Glutamatergic drive of the DR arises from many different brain areas with the capacity to inform the nucleus of sensory, autonomic, endocrine and metabolic state as well as higher order neural function. Imbalance of glutamatergic neurotransmission could contribute to maladaptive 5-HT neurotransmission and represents a potential target for pharmacotherapy. Within the DR, glutamate-containing axon terminals can be identified by their content of one of three types of vesicular glutamate transporter, VGLUT1, 2 or 3. Each of these transporters is heavily expressed in particular brain areas such that their content within axons correlates with the afferent's source. Cortical sources of innervation to the DR including the medial prefrontal cortex heavily express VGLUT1 whereas subcortical sources primarily express VGLUT2. Within the DR, many local neurons responsive to substance P contain VGLUT3, and these provide a third source of excitatory drive to 5-HT cells. Moreover VGLUT3 is present, with or without 5-HT, in output pathways from the DR. 5-HT and non-5-HT neurons receive and integrate glutamatergic neurotransmission through multiple subtypes of glutamate receptors that have different patterns of expression within the DR. Interestingly, excitatory drive provided by glutamatergic neurotransmission is closely opposed by feedback inhibition mediated by 5-HT1A receptors or local GABAergic circuits. Understanding the intricacies of these local networks and their checks and balances, may help identify how potential imbalances could cause psychopathology and illuminate strategies for therapeutic manipulation.",

        "des": "Highlights  The classical estrogen receptors ER and ER stimulate metabotropic glutamate receptors to initiate intracellular signaling cascades.  Different ERs and mGluRs are organized into functional signaling microdomains via caveolins.  There are brain region differences regarding the organization of ERs, mGluRs and caveolin proteins. Estradiol and other steroid hormones modulate the nervous system and behavior on both acute and long-term time scales. Though estradiol was originally characterized as a regulator of gene expression through the action of nuclear estrogen receptors (ERs) that directly bind DNA, research over the past thirty years has firmly established that estradiol can bind to extra-nuclear ERs associated with the cellular membrane, producing changes in neurons through stimulation of various intracellular signaling pathways. Several studies have determined that the classical ERs, ER and ER, mediate some of these fast-acting signaling pathways through activation of G proteins. Since ER and ER are not G protein-coupled receptors, the mechanisms by which ERs can stimulate signal transduction pathways are a focus of recent research. Here we discuss recent studies illustrating one mechanism by which ER and ER initiate these pathways: through direct association with metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). Estradiol binding to these membrane-localized estrogen receptors results in mGluR signaling independent of glutamate. ERs are organized with mGluRs into functional signaling microdomains via caveolin proteins. The pairing of ERs to specific mGluRs via caveolins is region specific, with ERs being linked to different mGluRs in hippocampal, striatal, and other neurons. It is becoming clear that ER signaling through mGluRs is one important mechanism by which estrogens can modulate neuron and glial physiology, ultimately impacting various aspects of nervous system function.",

Its critical developmental period extends into the first postnatal year, corresponding to the fetal transition to self-sustaining homeostasis.  Serotonergic-related disorders of early life can be unified under the rubric of developmental serotonopathies.  Developmental serotonopathies affect the rostral and/or caudal domain of serotonergic brainstem neurons.  Evidence is mounting that the sudden infant death syndrome is a developmental serotonopathy of the caudal domain. The caudal serotonergic (5-HT) system is a critical component of a medullary homeostatic network that regulates protective responses to metabolic stressors such as hypoxia, hypercapnia, and hyperthermia. We define anatomically the caudal 5-HT system in the human medulla as 5-HT neuronal cell bodies located in the raphe (raphe obscurus, raphe magnus, and raphe pallidus), extra-raphe (gigantocellularis, paragigantocellularis lateralis, intermediate reticular zone, lateral reticular nucleus, and nucleus subtrigeminalis), and ventral surface (arcuate nucleus). These 5-HT neurons are adjacent to all of the respiratory- and autonomic-related nuclei in the medulla where they are positioned to modulate directly the responses of these effector nuclei. In the following review, we highlight the topography and development of the caudal 5-HT system in the human fetus and infant, and its inter-relationships with nicotinic, GABAergic, and cytokine receptors. We also summarize pediatric disorders in early life which we term developmental serotonopathies of the caudal (as well as rostral) 5-HT domain and which are associated with homeostatic imbalances. The delineation of the development and organization of the human caudal 5-HT system provides the critical foundation for the neuropathologic elucidation of its disorders directly in the human brain.",

The hyrax shows, for the most part, a typically mammal-like orexinergic system, despite its unusual ancestry and phylogenetic position within the Afrotheria.  One interesting observation of dense orexinergic innervation of the antero-dorsal nucleus of the dorsal thalamus appears to be related to diurnality of this species and other mammalian species. The present study describes the distribution of orexin-A immunoreactive neurons and terminal networks in relation to the previously described catecholaminergic, cholinergic and serotonergic systems within the brain of the rock hyrax, Procavia capensis. Adult female rock hyrax brains were sectioned and immunohistochemically stained with an antibody to orexin-A. The staining revealed that the neurons were mainly located within the hypothalamus as with other mammals. The orexinergic terminal network distribution also resembled the typical mammalian plan. High-density orexinergic terminal networks were located within regions of the diencephalon (e.g. paraventricular nuclei), midbrain (e.g. serotonergic nuclei) and pons (locus coeruleus), while medium density orexinergic terminal networks were evident in the telencephalic (e.g. basal forebrain), diencephalic (e.g. hypothalamus), midbrain (e.g. periaqueductal gray matter), pontine (e.g. serotonergic nuclei) and medullary regions (e.g. serotonergic and catecholaminergic nuclei). Although the distribution of the orexinergic terminal networks was typically mammalian, the rock hyrax did show one atypical feature, the presence of a high-density orexinergic terminal network within the anterodorsal nucleus of the dorsal thalamus (AD). The dense orexinergic innervation of the AD nucleus has only been reported previously in the Nile grass rat, Arvicanthis niloticus and Syrian hamster, Mesocricetus auratus, both diurnal mammals. It is possible that orexinergic innervation of the AD nucleus might be a unique feature associated with diurnal mammals. It was also noted that the dense orexinergic innervation of the AD nucleus coincided with previously identified cholinergic neurons and terminal networks in this particular nucleus of the rock hyrax brain. It is possible that this dense orexinergic innervation of the AD nucleus in the brain of the rock hyrax may act in concert with the cholinergic neurons and/or the cholinergic axonal terminals, which in turn may influence arousal states and motivational processing.",

The present study describes the distribution of an arginine vasotocin (AVT) V1a receptor (AVTr) throughout the brain of a sex-changing grouper, rock hind Epinephelus adscensionis. The objectives of this study were to describe the AVTr distribution in the brain of rock hind for potential linkages of the AVT hormone system with sex-specific behaviors observed in this species and to examine sex-specific differences that might exist. An antibody was designed for rock hind AVTr against the deduced amino acid sequence for the third intracellular loop. Protein expression, identified with immunohistochemistry showed high concordance with mRNA expression, identified with in situ hybridization. AVTr protein and mRNA expression was widely distributed throughout the brain, indicating that AVT may act as a neuromodulator via this V1a receptor subtype. AVTr protein and mRNA were present in regions associated with behavior, reproduction and spatial learning, as well as sensory functions such as vision, olfaction and lateral line sensory processing.

Stress-sensitive monkeys showed an improvement in ovarian function after 15 weeks of citalopram treatment.  Stress-sensitive monkeys have reduced gene expression of Fev, TPH2, SERT and 5HT1A compared to stress-resilient monkeys.  Citalopram treatment did not improve Fev, TPH2, SERT or 5HT1A gene expression in stress-sensitive monkeys.  Stress-sensitive monkeys have greater CRF fiber density and less CRF-R2 expression in the raphe compared to stress-resilient monkeys.  Citalopram treatment decreased CRF fiber density and increased CRF-R2 expresssion in the dorsal raphe of stress-sensitive monkeys. This chapter reviews the neurobiological effects of stress sensitivity and s-citalpram (CIT) treatment observed in our nonhuman primate model of functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA). This type of infertility, also known as stress-induced amenorrhea, is exhibited by cynomolgus macaques. In small populations, some individuals are stress-sensitive (SS) and others are highly stress-resilient (HSR). The SS macaques have suboptimal secretion of estrogen and progesterone during normal menstrual cycles. SS monkeys also have decreased serotonin gene expression and increased CRF expression compared to HSR monkeys. Recently, we found that CIT treatment improved ovarian steroid secretion in SS monkeys, but had no effect in HSR monkeys. Examination of the serotonin system revealed that SS monkeys had significantly lower Fev (fifth Ewing variant, rodent Pet1), TPH2 (tryptophan hydroxylase 2), 5HT1A autoreceptor and SERT (serotonin reuptake transporter) expression in the dorsal raphe than SR monkeys. However, CIT did not alter the expression of either Fev, TPH2, SERT or 5HT1A mRNAs. In contrast, SS monkeys tended to have a higher density of CRF fiber innervation of the dorsal raphe than HSR monkeys, and CIT significantly decreased the CRF fiber density in SS animals. In addition, CIT increased CRF-R2 gene expression in the dorsal raphe. We speculate that in a 15-week time frame, the therapeutic effect of S-citalopram may be achieved through a mechanism involving extracellular serotonin inhibition of CRF and stimulation of CRF-R2, rather than alteration of serotonin-related gene expression.",

NB neurons display reduced NGF receptor expression in females with preclinical AD.  Lower NB NGF receptor levels track with low cognitive scores in females.  NB neurons also display reduced glutamate receptor expression in females with AD. The higher incidence rate of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in elderly women indicates that gender plays a role in AD pathogenesis. Evidence from clinical and pharmacologic studies, neuropathological examinations, and models of hormone replacement therapy suggest that cholinergic basal forebrain (CBF) cortical projection neurons within the nucleus basalis (NB), which mediate memory and attention and degenerate in AD, may be preferentially vulnerable in elderly women compared to men. CBF neurons depend on nerve growth factor (NGF) and their cognate receptors (trkA and p75 NTR) for their survival and maintenance. We recently demonstrated a shift in the balance of NGF and its receptors toward cell death mechanisms during the progression of AD. To address whether gender affects NGF signaling system expression within the CBF, we used single cell RNA amplification and custom microarray technologies to compare gene expression profiles of single cholinergic NB neurons in tissue specimens from male and female members of the Religious Orders Study who died with a clinical diagnosis of no cognitive impairment (NCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or mild/moderate AD. p75 NTR expression within male cholinergic NB neurons was unchanged across clinical diagnosis, whereas p75 NTR mRNA levels in female NB neurons exhibited a 40% reduction in AD compared to NCI. Male AD subjects displayed a 45% reduction in trkA mRNA levels within NB neurons compared to NCI and MCI. In contrast, NB neuronal trkA expression in females was reduced 50% in both MCI and AD compared to NCI. Reduced trkA mRNA levels were associated with poorer global cognitive performance and higher Braak scores in the female subjects. In addition, we found a female-selective reduction in GluR2 AMPA glutamate receptor subunit expression in NB neurons in AD. These data suggest that cholinergic NB neurons in females may be at greater risk for degeneration during the progression of AD and support the concept of gender-specific therapeutic interventions during the preclinical stages of the disease.",

Using two new monoclonal antibodies, specifically recognizing two different epitopes on the -synuclein sequence, we show that the sub-cellular localization of this protein changes in the different brain and spinal cord areas.  Our results indicate that -synuclein might absolve to more than one function in the neurons and that either pathological, or physiological behavior of this protein, could be due to a specific sub-cellular localization. Alpha-synuclein is a 140 amino acids protein, widely expressed in the nervous system of different vertebrates and closely related with several neurodegenerative disorders. Although its pathological involvement is reported from long time, its physiological function and its role in neurodegeneration is not yet clear. Disposing of two new monoclonal antibodies, able to detect alpha-synuclein in different compartments of the neurons, the aim of this study is to create an anatomical map of the protein's distribution in the central nervous system of C57 BL\\6J mouse, the mouse strain most sensitive to 1-methyl 4-phenyl 1,2,3,6-tetrahydro pyridine neurotoxicity and widely used to apply toxic models of Parkinson disease. The two monoclonal antibodies confirm their ability in visualizing the protein in distinct compartments of the neurons, since 2E3 detects alpha-synuclein in the nerve cells fibers, whereas 3D5 preferentially in the neuronal nuclei. Both antibodies, instead, are able to show alpha-synuclein at the synaptic terminals. The protein is ubiquitary distributed in the brain, as well as in the spinal cord, but its sub-cellular localization differs markedly in the various regions of the central nervous system. Among alpha-synuclein immunoreactive territories, we describe a particular organization in habenular nuclei, dorsal hippocampus, olfactory bulbs, brain stem nuclei and cerebellar cortex. This preliminary immunohistochemical study, provides the first anatomical map of the alpha-synuclein distribution in the C57 BL\\6J mouse CNS and suggests that alpha-synuclein is differentially localized, at sub-cellular level, in different types of neurons and that, therefore, it can plays a specific role for each neuronal subtype.

Moreover, the distribution of TH has been compared with that of CGRP by double immunohistochemistry. Double-labelled neurons were very isolated and observed only in a few catecholaminergic groups: A1 and C2 in the medulla oblongata, A6d, A7sc and A7d in the pons, and A9l in the mesencephalon.

Endocytic system dysfunction is one of the earliest disturbances that occur in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and may underlie the selective vulnerability of cholinergic basal forebrain (CBF) neurons during the progression of dementia. Herein we report that genes regulating early and late endosomes are selectively upregulated within CBF neurons in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. Specifically, upregulation of rab4, rab5, rab7, and rab27 was observed in CBF neurons microdissected from postmortem brains of individuals with MCI and AD compared to age-matched control subjects with no cognitive impairment (NCI). Upregulated expression of rab4, rab5, rab7, and rab27 correlated with antemortem measures of cognitive decline in individuals with MCI and AD. qPCR validated upregulation of these select rab GTPases within microdissected samples of the basal forebrain. Moreover, quantitative immunoblot analysis demonstrated upregulation of rab5 protein expression in the basal forebrain of subjects with MCI and AD. The elevation of rab4, rab5, and rab7 expression is consistent with our recent observations in CA1 pyramidal neurons in MCI and AD. These findings provide further support that endosomal pathology accelerates endocytosis and endosome recycling, which may promote aberrant endosomal signaling and neurodegeneration throughout the progression of AD.",

Their outputs target the basal forebrain, extended amygdala, and diencephalon.  The densest projection was to the hypothalamus.  These data provide a neuroanatomical framework for studying salt appetite. The transcription factor Forkhead box protein 2 (FoxP2) is expressed in two cell groups of the brainstem that have been implicated in sodium appetite regulation: the pre-locus coeruleus (pre-LC) and parabrachial nucleus  external lateral-inner subdivision (PBel-inner). Because the connections of these two groups are unknown, neuroanatomical tracing methods were used to define their central projections. The pre-LC outputs were first analyzed using an anterograde axonal tracer Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHAL) to construct a brain map. Next, we examined whether the FoxP2 immunoreactive (FoxP2+) neurons of the pre-LC contribute to these projections using a retrograde neuronal tracer  cholera toxin -subunit (CTb). CTb was injected into selected brain regions identified in the anterograde tracing study. One week later the rats were killed, and brainstem sections were processed by a double immunohistochemical procedure to determine whether the FoxP2+ neurons in the pre-LC and/or PBel-inner contained CTb. FoxP2+ pre-LC neurons project to: (1) ventral pallidum; (2) substantia innominata and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis; (3) paraventricular, central medial, parafascicular, and subparafascicular parvicellular thalamic nuclei; (4) paraventricular (PVH), lateral, perifornical, dorsomedial (DMH), and parasubthalamic hypothalamic nuclei; and (5) ventral tegmental area (VTA), periaqueductal gray matter (PAG), dorsal and central linear raphe nuclei. FoxP2+ PBel-inner neurons project to the PVH and DMH, with weaker connections to the LHA, VTA, and PAG. Both the pre-LC and PBel-inner project to central sites implicated in sodium appetite, and related issues, including foraging behavior, hedonic responses to salt intake, sodium balance, and cardiovascular regulation, are discussed.",

These mole rats show, for the most part, a typically rodent like orexinergic system, despite the greatly reduced visual system.

The distribution of orexinergic cell bodies and terminal networks within the brains of two species of African mole rat (Cape-dune mole rat  Bathyergus suillus and highveld mole rat  Cryptomys hottentotus) were identified using immunohistochemistry for orexin-A. The aim of the study was to investigate possible differences in the nuclear complement and terminal distribution of this system by comparing those of the mole rats to published studies of other rodents and mammals. The wild-caught mole rats used in this study live a subterranean lifestyle and are well known for their regressed visual system, which may lead to the prediction of differences in the distribution of the cell bodies and the terminal networks; however, we found that both species of mole rat displayed orexinergic nuclei limited to the hypothalamus in regions similar to those previously reported for other rodent and mammalian species. No immunoreactive neurons could be identified, in either species of mole rat within the anterior hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, as has been reported for Murid rodents.

Materials and methods Two groups of mice were used. Transgenic animals in which the murine Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) gene has been partly replaced by the human APP including both the Swedish and London mutations and that overexpress a mutant of the human Presenilin 1 gene (PS1M146L) driven by the PDGF promoter. The transgenic mice (App SL/PS1 M146L) aged 24  3 months were used. The second group was an age matched control group of C57 black mice. The bladders from each group were isolated, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and prepared for immunohistochemistry. Antibodies to the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) were used to identify neural structures. Results Cholinergic nerves (VAChT +) were observed in the inner and outer muscle bundles of App SL/PS1 M146L and control mice. No major differences were noted in the distribution of these fibres. In contrast, there was a distinct difference in the innervation of the sub-urothelial layer. In App1 SL/PS1 M146L mice there were numerous VAChT and nNOS positive fibres in sharp contrast to the paucity of similar nerves in control animals. VAChT and nNOS did not appear to co-localise in the same nerve fibres within the lamina propria. Pairs of nerve fibres, nNOS + and VAChT +, were observed to be intertwined and run in close proximity. A particularly unusual feature of the App SL/PS1 M146L mouse bladder was the presence of neurones within the bladder wall. These nerve cell bodies were seen in all App SL/PS1 M146L mouse bladders. The neurones could be found singly or in small ganglion like groups of cells and were located in all layers of the bladder wall (sub-urothelium, in the lamina propria adjacent to the inner muscle and within the inner muscle and outer muscle layers). No nerve cells or small ganglia were noted in any of the control bladders studied. Conclusions There are structural differences in the bladders of App SL/PS1 M146L mice compared to control animals. These differences are associated with sub-urothelial nerves which, because of their location, are likely to be sensory fibres. This may lead to a changed sensory processing from the App SL/PS1 M146L bladders. The physiological role of the intra-mural neurones and ganglia is not known. It is speculated that they may be associated with peripheral motor/sensory mechanisms linked to the generation and modulation of sensation.",

Numerous NPY-like immunoreactive (NPY-LI) neurons and fibers were detected in the DRG and CN of the diabetic MNT (DMNT) rats respectively, but not in those with diabetes-alone. Following MNT, the time-course of NPY expression pattern in the diabetic DRG and CN was similar and both peaked at 2 weeks, which was earlier than those in the non-diabetic MNT rats. Consequently, the expression of neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) immunoreactivity in DRG neurons was coincidentally decreased and reached the nadir at 2 weeks in the diabetic MNT rats, which was also earlier than that in the non-diabetic MNT rats. Following electrical stimulation of the injured nerves, the number of NPY-LI fibers became attenuated and the induced c-Fos-LI cells concurrently appeared in the ipsilateral CN. In the diabetic CN, the number of c-Fos-LI cells also peaked at 2 weeks after MNT, which was consistent with the temporal pattern of changes in NPY expression. The results suggest that in diabetes, MNT induced NPY expression via the reduction of NT-3, and electrical stimulation of the injured median nerve evoked the release of NPY and accordingly more c-Fos-LI cells were identified in the CN. Furthermore, this study demonstrated early NPY and c-Fos expression in the diabetic rats after MNT, suggesting that the development of neuropathic signs may be advanced in hyperglycemic rats.",

Short-term effects of adrenalectomy (ADX) in type 2 diabetes are well characterized; however, there have been few reports on the long-term effects of ADX in genetically engineered type 2 diabetes and the neuroendocrine system. We performed bilateral ADX in Zucker Lean Control rats (ZLC; ADX-ZLC), Zucker Diabetic Fatty rats (ZDF; ADX-ZDF), and sham control rats to evaluate how the HPA axis would be regulated in long-term corticosterone deficient type 2 diabetic animals. We evaluated arginine vasopressin (AVP), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) expression with immunohistochemistry (IHC), immunofluorescence, real-time PCR, and Western blot analysis in each treatment group 7 weeks post ADX to assess HPA axis regulatory patterns in connection with type 2 diabetes. Additionally, mRNA expression of AVP and CRH receptors (V1aR, V1bR, CRHR1, and CRHR2) was also measured and adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) immunoreactivity was surveyed by IHC to add to data regarding the regulatory mechanism. AVP and CRH protein expression levels increased after ADX in the hypothalamus of diabetic rats based on IHC results; however, we found that the subtypes of each receptor may be regulated differently in ADX groups compared to sham groups. Immunoreactivity of ACTH in the pituitary gland was enhanced in ADX groups and GR expression levels in the hypothalamic paraventricular nuclei (PVN) remained high, as determined by IHC as well as Western blot analysis. Without the negative feedback system of corticosterone, CRH is highly enhanced and may primarily combine with CRHR1 to stimulate negative feedback through ACTH in the pituitary gland in type 2 diabetic rats with long-term ADX. Although the negative feedback signal was not transmitted appropriately following long-term ADX with type 2 diabetes, a high GR protein level was maintained as in type 2 diabetes. The long-termed lack of corticosterone in the blood stream is a very important factor for normal regulation of the HPA axis even in diabetic animals. From the data, we can conclude that the stimulated HPA axis regulation in the developing type 2 diabetic animals following long-term adrenalectomy has remained elevated rather than diminished. Therefore, the current study may provide useful information to better understand patients suffering from both type 2 diabetes and Addison's disease.",

We delineated the SNr in the midbrain tegmentum by labeling the striatonigral terminal field by means of GABA-, substance P-, and enkephalin immunohistochemistry and striatal tracer injections. Subsequently, we used double fluorescence tracing with injections into the SNr and GP to stain different parts of the indirect pathway. Confocal laser scan analysis revealed that dcSC, EP, and vVM/VL contain retrogradely labeled neurons projecting to the SNr, contacted by anterogradely labeled terminals arising in the GP. Immunohistochemical stainings with antibodies against glutamate and the glutamate transporters EAAC1 and vGluT2 demonstrated that the investigated nuclei contain glutamatergic neurons.

In this review article, we describe the similarities and differences, both anatomical and functional, between the avian and mammalian noradrenergic system and its role in sensory processing, learning, attention and synaptic modulation. We also describe how the noradrenergic system influences motor production, an under-explored aspect of norepinephrine function in mammalian studies. We argue that the richness of behaviors observed in songbirds provides a unique opportunity to study the noradrenergic system in a highly integrative manner that will ultimately provide important insights into the role of this system in normal behavior and disease.",

In the present report, we describe the immunohistochemical distribution and biological activity of 3-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3-HSD) and 5-reductase (5-R) in the brain of the European green frog, Rana esculenta, during larval development. The spatio-temporal distribution of 3-HSD and 5-R immunoreactivities in the tadpole brain was generally different, although these two enzymes were occasionally detected in the same areas such as the olfactory bulbs and cerebellum. Identification of neurons based on their morphological aspect as well as labeling of astrocytes with an antiserum against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) revealed that, in the tadpole brain, 3-HSD- and 5-R-immunoreactive materials were contained in both neurons and glial cells. Incubation of tadpole brain explants with [ 3H]-pregnenolone resulted in the formation of several tritiated steroids including progesterone, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, androstenedione, 5-dihydroprogesterone and 5-dihydrotestosterone. The present study provides the first immunocytochemical mapping of two key steroidogenic enzymes in the developing frog brain. The data also indicate that neurosteroid biosynthesis occurs in the brain of tadpoles, as previously shown for adult amphibians, birds and mammals. The transient expression of steroidogenic enzymes in several regions of the tadpole brain suggests that, in amphibians, neurosteroids may be implicated in neurotrophic activities during larval development.",

A higher proportion of Type II fragment was found within the forelimb representation.  Bi-lateral sensorimotor behavior in the agouti is restricted to the forelimbs.  Axon morphological differences may contribute to these distinct somatomotor skills. The integration of cutaneous, proprioceptive, and motor information in area S2 seems to be essential for manual object recognition and motor control. Part of the inputs to S2 comes from area S1. However no detailed investigations of the morphology of this projection are available. In the present study we describe and quantify the morphology of axon fragments of S1 to S2 ipsilateral projections in the agouti somatosensory cortex. Two groups of projecting axon arbors in S2 were individually reconstructed in three dimensions using Neurolucida, after a single electrophysiological guided BDA injection in either the forelimb ( n = 4) or the hindlimb ( n = 4). Electrophysiological mapping was performed 15 days after injections, allowing the localization of S2. Cluster analysis of 40 fragments after hindlimb and 40 after forelimb distinguished two clusters of terminals designated as type I and type II. On average, Type I fragments had greater surface areas and segment lengths than type II fragments, whereas type II fragments had higher number of terminal boutons, number of segments and branching points/mm than type I fragments. Type I corresponded to 58% of the axons projecting from the hindlimb representation in S1 whereas 63% of the sample originating from the forelimb representation in S1 corresponded to type II axons.

Immunolabelling of adjacent semi-thin sections nonetheless indicated a close correspondence between cells and puncta labelled by glycine and GABA antisera in certain NTS areas. With post-embedding electron microscopic immunolabelling, synaptic terminals with high, presumed transmitter levels of glycine were discriminated from terminals containing low, metabolic levels by quantitative analysis of gold particle labelling densities. In a random sample of terminals, 28.5% qualified on this basis as glycinergic (compared to 44.4% GABAergic); these glycinergic terminals targeted mainly dendritic structures and contained pleomorphic vesicles and symmetrical synapses. Serial section analysis revealed few terminals (5.2%) immunoreactive for glycine alone, with 82% of glycinergic terminals also containing high levels of GABA immunoreactivity. No evidence for co-localisation of glycine and glutamate was found. Light, confocal and electron microscopic labelling with antibodies to proteins specific for glycine and GABA synthesis, release and uptake confirmed that glycinergic terminals also containing GABA are found predominantly in more lateral areas of NTS, despite glycine receptors and the glial glycine transporter (GLYT1) being expressed throughout all areas of the nucleus.

During the past 30 years numerous studies have investigated how seasonal changes, transduced largely but not exclusively through changes in sex steroid concentrations, affect singing frequency and quality by modulating the structure and activity of the song control circuit. These studies showed that testosterone or its metabolite estradiol, control seasonal variation in singing quality by a direct action on song control nuclei. These studies also gave rise to the hypothesis that the probability of song production in response to a given stimulus (i.e. its motivation) is controlled through effects on the medial preoptic area and on catecholaminergic cell groups that project to song control nuclei. Selective pharmacological manipulations confirmed that the noradrenergic system indeed plays a role in the control of singing behavior.

Moreover, dramatic up-regulation of growth associated protein-43 (GAP-43) expression was detected in the ipsilateral VG neurons. The mean percentage of substance P-like immunoreactive (SP-LI) neurons in the treated VG (81.8  1.9%) was significantly higher than that in the control VG (68.6  3.3%). Conversely, the mean percentage of neuropeptide Y-like immunoreactive (NPY-LI) neurons in the treated VG (13.7  3.8%) was dramatically lower than that in the control VG (49.0  3.8%). Double labeling results shown 82% of SP-LI and 16% of NPY-LI neurons coexpressed with GAP-43, suggested that SP accumulating coincided with NPY decreasing in regenerating VG neurons after gentamicin treatment. Overall, the changes in SP and NPY expression in VG neurons after gentamicin treatment were like to those in the superior cervical ganglion following sympathectomy.",

Progress has been made in understanding the neural basis of song learning and sensorimotor processing, however little is known about neurobiological mechanisms regulating the motivation to sing. Neural systems involved in motivation and reward have been conserved across species and in songbirds are neuroanatomically well-positioned to influence the song control system. Opioid neuropeptides within these systems play a primary role in hedonic reward, at least in mammals. In songbirds, opioid neuropeptides and receptors are found throughout the song control system and within several brain regions implicated in both motivation and reward, including the medial preoptic nucleus (POM) and ventral tegmental area (VTA). Growing research shows these regions to play a role in birdsong that differs depending upon whether song is sexually motivated in response to a female, used for territorial defense or sung as part of a flock but not directed towards an individual (undirected song). Opioid pharmacological manipulations and immunocytochemical data demonstrate a role for opioid activity possibly within VTA and POM in the regulation of song production. Although future research is needed, data suggest that opioids may be most critically involved in reinforcing song that does not result in any obvious form of immediate externally mediated reinforcement, such as undirected song produced in large flocks or during song learning. Data are reviewed supporting the idea that dopamine activity underlies the motivation or drive to sing, but that opioid release is what makes song production rewarding.",

Since activated Notch signaling regulates cellular fate in the developing nervous system, similar regulation may exist in the injured adult brain. To monitor the Notch signaling pathway, we examined whether components of the signaling pathway were co-expressed in Notch1-positive cells.

The nuclear organization of all three systems within the giraffe brain was similar to that of other Artiodactyls.

The putative catecholaminergic system of the giraffe appeared to lack an A15 dorsal nucleus, which is commonly seen in other mammals but absent in the Artiodactyls, had a large and expanded substantia nigra pars reticulata (A9 ventral), a small diffuse portion of the locus coerueleus (A6d), an expansive subcoeruleus (A7sc and A7d), and lacked the A4 nucleus of the locus coeruleus complex. The nuclear organization of the serotonergic system of the giraffe was identical to that seen in all other eutherian mammals studied to date.

Molecular cloning has revealed over 100 genes encoding the pore-forming  subunits of potassium channels in mammals, making them the most diverse subset of ion channels. Multiplicity in this ion channel family is further generated through alternative splicing. The precise location of potassium channels along the dendro-somato-axonic surface of the neurons is an important factor in determining its functional impact. Today, it is widely accepted that potassium channels can be located at any subcellular compartment on the neuronal surface, at synaptic and extrasynaptic sites, from somata to dendritic shafts, dendritic spines, axons or axon terminals. However, they are not evenly distributed on the neuronal surface and depending on the potassium channel subtype, are instead concentrated at different compartments. This selective localization of ion channels to specific neuronal compartments has many different functional implications. One factor necessary to understand the role of potassium channels in neuronal function is to unravel their specialized distribution and subcellular localization within a cell, and this can only be achieved by electron microscopy. In this review, I summarize anatomical findings, describing their distribution in the central nervous system.

During lactation, melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) mRNA and peptide expression are increased in the medial preoptic area (MPO) and in the anterior paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. Here we show that MCH neurons in the MPO coexpress the GABA synthesizing enzyme GAD-67 mRNA. We also show that MCH neurons in the MPO of female rats are innervated by neuropeptides that control energy homeostasis including agouti-related protein (AgRP), -melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH) and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART). Most of these inputs originate from the arcuate nucleus neurons. Additionally, using injections of retrograde tracers we found that CART neurons in the ventral premammillary nucleus also innervate the MPO. We then assessed the projections of the female MPO using injections of anterograde tracers. The MPO densely innervates hypothalamic nuclei related to reproductive control including the anteroventral periventricular nucleus, the ventrolateral subdivision of the ventromedial nucleus (VMHvl) and the ventral premammillary nucleus (PMV). We found that the density of MCH-ir fibers is increased in the VMHvl and PMV during lactation. Our findings suggest that the expression of MCH in the MPO may be induced by changing levels of neuropeptides involved in metabolic control.

Phylogenetic analysis indicates that lVGLUT cannot be assigned to any of the three VGLUT isoforms characterized in teleosts and mammals, suggesting that these classes may have been fixed after the splitting between cyclostomes and gnathostomes. Expression pattern analysis during lamprey embryogenesis and prolarval stages shows that lVGluT expression is restricted to the nervous system. The first structure to express lVGluT was the olfactory epithelium of late embryos. In the brain of early prolarvae, lVGluT was expressed in most of the neuronal populations that generate the early axonal scaffold. lVGluT expression was also observed in neuronal populations of the rhombencephalon and spinal cord and in ganglia of the branchiomeric, octaval and posterior lateral line nerves. In the rhombencephalon, lVGluT expression appears to be spatially restricted in dorsal and ventral longitudinal domains.

Steroid production enzymes are found in neuronal cell bodies, but they are also expressed in pre-synaptic terminals in the song system, indicating a novel mode of brain steroid delivery to local circuits. The song system expresses nuclear hormone receptors, consistent with local action of brain-derived steroids. Local steroid production also occurs in brain regions that do not express nuclear hormone receptors, suggesting a non-classical mode of action. Recent evidence indicates that local steroid levels can change rapidly within the forebrain, in a manner similar to traditional neuromodulators.

This finding suggests that OCC1-related proteins play crucial roles in the visual processing pathway. In the present study, we examined mRNA expression patterns of OCC1-related genes in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of macaques. The mRNAs of testican-1 and testican-2 were strongly expressed in both excitatory projection neurons and GABAergic interneurons in the dLGN. Expression of testican-3 mRNA, which is predominantly observed in GABAergic interneurons in the cortex, was restricted to excitatory projection neurons in the dLGN. SPARC mRNA was strongly, and exclusively, expressed in glial cells in the dLGN. Interestingly, neuronal SC1 mRNA expression was abundantly observed in intercalated, koniocellular layers of the dLGN, while it was preferentially observed in blob regions of the primary visual area that receives color coding K-pathway projection from dLGN koniocellular layers, suggesting a pathway preference of expression. Finally, monocular inactivation experiments demonstrated that expression of testican-1, testican-2 and testican-3 mRNAs in the dLGN is dependent on sensory activity.

A dimorphic sexual difference in the number of MC4-R-positive neurons was observed in some brain regions. In the medial preoptic area and arcuate nucleus, MC4-R-positive neurons were significantly more abundant in female than in males, whereas in the lateral hypothalamus the opposite proportion was observed. This is the first time the neuroanatomical distribution, and sex differences, of brain MC4-R localisation have been described. The distribution of MC4-R is consistent with the proposed roles of MC4-R-positive neurons and provides further information about the circuitry controlling food intake, energy balance and sexual responses in both males and females.",

The relationship between dopaminergic neuronal structures and dopaminoceptive structures in the amphibian brain and spinal cord are assessed by means of single and double immunohistochemical techniques with antibodies directed against DARPP-32 (a phosphoprotein related to the dopamine D 1-receptor) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) applied to the brain of the anurans Rana perezi and Xenopus laevis. The DARPP-32 antibody yielded a well-differentiated pattern of staining in the brain of these anurans. In general, areas that are densely innervated by TH-immunoreactive fibers such as the nucleus accumbens, striatum, amygdaloid complex, thalamus, optic tectum, torus semicircularis and spinal cord display a remarkable immunoreactivity for DARPP-32 in cell bodies and neuropil. Distinct cellular DARPP-32 immunoreactivity was also found in the septum, preoptic area, suprachiasmatic nucleus, tuberal hypothalamic region, habenula, retina, midbrain tegmentum, rhombencephalic reticular formation and solitary tract nucleus. Hodological data supported that striatal projection neurons were DARPP-32 immunoreactive. Double immunohistofluorescence staining revealed that catecholaminergic cells generally do not stain for DARPP-32, except for some cells in the ventral mesencephalic tegmentum of Xenopus and cells in the nucleus of the solitary tract of Rana. Several interspecies differences were noted for the DARPP-32 distribution in the brain of the two anurans, namely in the habenula, the thalamus and prethalamus, the cerebellum and octavolateral area and the structures with DARPP-32/TH colocalization.

In adolescent rats, only the single dose of HU210 had an effect on D1 density.  In adolescent rats, D2 receptor density was unaffected in all HU210 treatment groups. Animal studies suggest differential effects of cannabinoids on dopamine-related behaviours in adolescence and adulthood however few studies have investigated the underlying neurochemical effects of cannabinoids during adolescence. The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of treatment with the synthetic cannabinoid, HU210, on dopamine receptor density in adolescent and adult rats. Adolescent (postnatal day (PND) 35) and adult (PND 70) rats received a single dose of 100 g/kg HU210 or 25, 50 or 100 g/kg HU210 for 4 or 14 days.

Meyers is a reputed scientist who has edited several ambitious multivolume reference books (for instance, the Encyclopedia of Analytical Chemistry or the Encyclopedia of Molecular Biology and Molecular Medicine, among many others), some of them with great success. This combination of expertise and experience put him in a perfect position to edit Neurobiology: From molecular basis to disease. The book is a two volume set compiled from a carefully chosen collection of articles on neurobiology from the highly acclaimed Robert A. Meyer's Encyclopedia of Molecular Cell Biology and Molecular Medicine. The book is clearly divided into three sections covering the whole range of topics on cell biology, biochemistry and development of the nervous system, subdivided in two sections included in volume 1, and a more focused section on neurological diseases, included in volume 2. This book review only covers the first volume of Neurobiology: From molecular basis to disease. This is a multi-author book that contains a collection of high-quality chapters. The most outstanding work of the editor is bringing together renowned experts and leaders from multiple basic and clinical disciplines, including several Nobel laureates, to provide a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art research on neurobiology. This is a notable achievement making the book rewarding for the reader. The book contains 11 chapters subdivided in two sections. The section covering the cell biology and biochemistry of the nervous system contains 7 chapters dealing with single cell neurobiology, neuron chemistry, neurotransmitter receptor biochemistry, rhythmic and temporal processes in biology, sense of smell, gating and modulation of ion channels in pain transduction, and invertebrate neuropeptides. The following chapters covering the Neurodevelopmental Biology section describe brain development, stem cells in the adult brain, behavior genes and neurobiology and development of nematodes. Each of the 11 chapters, conceived as a self-contained treatment, is uniformly structured that includes a concise summary of the article, a glossary of the most important keywords, including definitions, descriptive illustrations, informative tables and a list of literature references, providing complete citations, to guide the reader deeper into the literature. The result is an excellent book that may contain the most comprehensive and detailed treatment of neurobiology available today. As a shortcoming, some of the chapters on related topics contain overlap in content. I was initially disappointed by the lack criteria of choosing some articles and not others. For instance, I found no clear evidence why the chapter on sense of smell was chosen among other senses, but then I realised that this is directly related with the reputation of the contributing authors. In summary, this is an essential reading on neurobiology and as such there is no doubt that Neurobiology: From molecular basis to disease will find a broad audience, including neurobiologists, cell biologists, molecular biologists, biochemists, biotechnologists, developmental biologists and pharmacologists. But the book is designed for readers at any level of expertise and, therefore, several of its features will be also very helpful to students. All readers in search of basic aspects of neurobiology will find a source of inspiration in this book and no science or medical library should be without it.",

On the other side, neuropeptide Y (NPY) neurons of the arcuate (ARC) nucleus are potentially involved in the control of gonadotrophins in prepubertal lambs and also of growth hormone (GH) secretion in adults. This study therefore investigated whether the transition from the prepubertal to the peripubertal period is accompanied by changes in NPY-ir and NPY mRNA content in neurons of the ARC nucleus and their putative projections to somatostatin neurons in both the ARC and periventricular (PEV) nuclei. The hypothalami of prepubertal (17-week-old) and peripubertal (32-week-old) female lambs were compared using single and double-labelling immunohistochemistry, and hybridisation in situ for NPY. Single-labelling for NPY mRNA and NPY-ir was quantified by image analysis using a light microscope and expressed as the percent area stained and/or the integral density of the reaction. Double-labelling for NPY-somatostatin relationships was analysed by confocal microscopy. Our data suggest that there are no detectable changes in NPY-ir in the PEV nucleus in the period leading up to puberty, whereas both the distributional area and intensity of NPY-labelling in the ARC are significantly higher in peripubertal compared to prepubertal sheep. In contrast, NPY mRNA levels are higher in prepubertal than in peripubertal ewes in the ARC nucleus. Confocal microscopy suggests the existence of NPY-somatostatin axo-somatic contacts in both PEV and ARC nuclei. In the PEV nucleus, the number of close appositions between NPY-ir fibres and somatostatin-ir perikarya is higher in prepubertal than in peripubertal ewes, but in the ARC no such difference was observed. In conclusion, our observations suggest that there is decreased activity of the NPY neurons of the ARC nucleus closely related to somatostatin neurons in the PEV nucleus at the onset of puberty. The withdrawal of this NPY effect may allow a higher release of somatostatin, which consequently inhibits GH secretion and stops growth. Both peptides are involved in the transmission of signals leading to stop growth at puberty.",

Cholinergic input, principally from the basal forebrain has been implicated in some of these state-dependent properties. Cholinergic modulation may affect numerous song system nuclei, with in vivo and in vitro studies indicating that a major target of cholinergic input is the forebrain nucleus HVC. Within HVC, a muscarinic cholinergic system has strong regulatory effects on most neurons, and may serve to couple and uncouple circuitry within HVC projecting along the premotor pathway with circuitry within HVC projecting along the cortico-basal ganglia pathway.

The expression of both these receptors in the normally aging human substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) needs to be studied since GDNF infusion is being considered for restoration of the lost nigrostriatal function. In the present study, we used unbiased stereology to quantify the number of GFR1 and RET immunoreactive neurons in human SNpc from 28 weeks of gestation to 88 years ( n = 31). We further determined the levels of immunostaining intensity using densitometric image analysis to measure changes in levels of receptor expression. Here we report that human nigral dopaminergic neurons express GFR1 and RET receptors at all ages. There was no reduction in the number of neurons expressing these receptors as a function of age. Moreover, there was no age-related decline in immunostaining intensity of both these receptors. It is likely that preservation of GDNF receptors in the nigral neurons is because these receptors are constitutively expressed in the human SNpc and thus it is GDNF responsive thru aging.

DA neurons in the ventral tegmental area were recently shown to fire in bursts during PS, but nothing is known about the activity of the other DA cell groups in relation to waking or PS. To fulfil this gap, we used a protocol in which rats were maintained in continuous W for 3 h in a novel environment, or specifically deprived of PS for 3 days with some of them allowed to recover from this deprivation. A double immunohistochemical labeling with Fos and tyrosine hydroxylase was then performed. DA neurons in the substantia nigra (A9) and ventral tegmental area (A10), and its dorsocaudal extension in the periaqueductal gray (A10dc), almost never showed a Fos-immunoreactive nucleus, regardless of the experimental condition. The caudal hypothalamic (A11) group showed a moderate activation after PS deprivation and novel environment. During PS-recovery, the zona incerta (A13) group contained a significant number and percentage of double-labeled neurons. These results suggest that some DA neurons (A11) could participate in waking and/or the inhibition of PS during PS deprivation whereas others (A13) would be involved in the control of PS.",

The nervous system is divided into functional groupings-specialized neuronal networks that subserve particular functions, such as feature detectors in a sensory system, cortical columns and the networks underlying different patterns of motor behavior. The book entitled \"MICROCIRCUITS. The interface between neurons and global brain function\", edited by S. Grillner and A.M. Graybiel is a publication of the Dahlem Workshop that discussed such functional groupings as microcircuits and focused on the intrinsic function of these microcircuits. The organization of the groups is well resolved in the book, which highlights the perspectives, controversies, gaps in knowledge and future research directions of this important topic. The book is organized in 19 well written chapters accompanied by a complete set of references that represent four groups of different types of well-defined microcircuits: microcircuits in the motor system, microcircuits in the striatum, olfactory microcircuits, and neocortical microcircuits. The first group is defined in terms of the functions of three vertebrate motor circuits: those coordinating locomotion, respiration, and the saccadic eye movements. These represent three neuronal networks with different functions that operate on different time scales, but a common principle emerged from the discussion in that the core of each pattern of motor activity appears to depend on excitatory glutamatergic neurons that interact and generate burst activity. The second section overviews microcircuits in the striatum, the largest input station of the basal ganglia, describing that this area is important for both motor function and cognition. The goal of this group was to try to identify a core striatal microcircuit and to delineate striatal microcircuitry that most likely is part of the decision-making functions of the striatum contributing to the dynamic selection of different patterns of behavior. The goal of the third group was to discuss the microcircuitry within the glomerulus and the circuits connecting glomeruli. This group highlight the significance of this conserved organization in different invertebrates and vertebrates species. The chapters that represent the 4th group discuss how the inhibitory and excitatory neurons in the neocortex interact, both locally in the range of a few hundred microns and via long-distance interactions with other parts of neocortex and also with other structures to assume cognitive functions. Over all, this book is well written and widely considers the most outstanding research in the microcircuitry of the central nervous system. Therefore, we recommend his reading to those involved in related fields.",

Here, we examine the compartmentation of the cerebellar cortex of a group of birds with unique cerebellar morphologyhummingbirds (Trochilidae). Immunohistochemical techniques were used to characterize the expression of zebrin II (aldolase C) and phospholipase C4 (PLC4) in the cerebellar cortex of two hummingbird species. A series of zebrin II immunopositive/immunonegative parasagittal stripes was apparent across most folia representing three major transverse zones: an anterior zone with a central stripe flanked by three lateral stripes on either side; a central zone of high/low immunopositive stripes; and a posterior zone with a central stripe flanked by four to six lateral stripes on either side. In addition, both folia I and X were uniformly immunopositive. The pattern of PLC4 immunoreactivity was largely complementaryPLC4 positive stripes were zebrin II negative and vice versa. The similarity of zebrin II expression between the hummingbirds and the pigeon indicates that the neurochemical compartmentation of the cerebellar cortex in birds is highly conserved, but species differences in the number and width of stripes do occur.",

The use of a monoclonal ChAT antiserum against whole rat ChAT protein allowed for an optimal visualization of the small dendritic branches and fine varicose axons of cholinergic interneurons. PHA-L-labeled thalamic afferents were heterogeneously distributed throughout the core and shell regions of nAcb, overlapping regionally with cholinergic somata and dendrites. At the ultrastructural level, several hundred single-section profiles of PHA-L and ChAT-labeled axon terminals were analyzed for morphology, synaptic frequency, and the nature of their synaptic targets. The cholinergic profiles were small and apposed to various neuronal elements, but rarely exhibited a synaptic membrane specialization (5% in single ultrathin sections). Stereological extrapolation indicated that less than 15% of these cholinergic varicosities were synaptic. The PHA-L-labeled profiles were comparatively large and often synaptic (37% in single ultrathin sections), making asymmetrical contacts primarily with dendritic spines (>90%). Stereological extrapolation indicated that all PHA-L-labeled terminals were synaptic. In double-labeled material, some PHA-L-labeled terminals were directly apposed to ChAT-labeled somata or dendrites, but synapses were never seen between the two types of elements. These observations demonstrate that the cholinergic innervation of rat nAcb is largely asynaptic. They confirm that the afferents from midline/intralaminar/paraventricular thalamic nuclei to rat nAcb synapse mostly on dendritic spines, presumably of medium spiny neurons, and suggest that the excitatory drive of nAcb cholinergic interneurons from thalamus is indirect, either via substance P release from recurrent collaterals of medium spiny neurons and/or by extrasynaptic diffusion of glutamate.",

Perikarya and dendrites of Purkinje cells are contacted by numerous stellate cell small CR-ir boutons.

Cell body sizes and catecholaminergic and serotonergic innervation patterns were investigated in brain areas expected to be sensitive to differences in environmental stimulation: hippocampal substructures and the nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL), a functional analogue of the prefrontal cortex. Our analysis shows both structures differing in the affected morphological parameters. Compared to battery cage hens, hens in the free range system developed larger cells in the dorsomedial hippocampus. Only these animals exhibited an asymmetry in the tyrosine hydroxylase density with more fibres in the left dorsomedial hippocampus. We assume that the higher spatial complexity of the free range system is the driving force of these changes. In contrast, in the NCL the housing systems affected only the serotonergic innervation pattern with highest fibre densities in free range hens. Moreover hens of the free range system displayed the worst plumage condition, which most likely is caused by feather pecking causing an altered serotonergic innervation pattern. Considering the remarkable differences between the three housing conditions, their effects on hippocampal structures and the NCL were surprisingly mild. This observation suggests that the adult brain of laying hens displays limited sensitivity to differences in social and physical environment induced post-puberty, which warrants further studies.",

Given the importance of zebrafish in studies on the genetic manipulation of retinal development and function, precise data on the synaptic neurochemical organization of the zebrafish retina is needed. Immunohistochemical techniques were used to determine the ultrastructural localization of glutamate receptor subunits GluR2, GluR4, NMDA2B (NR2B) and mGluR1 in zebrafish outer plexiform layer (OPL). These antibodies were chosen because of an apparent conservation of localization of GluR2, GluR4 and mGluR1 in the vertebrate OPL, while there is some support for NMDA receptors in the OPL. GluR2-immunoreactivity (IR) was in all horizontal cell dendrites that invaginated cone pedicles and rod spherules. Three arrangements of dendrites contained GluR-IR in rod spherules: classical-type with GluR2-IR on lateral horizontal cell dendrites, a butterfly-shaped horizontal cell dendrite, and a goblet-shaped dendrite, likely of bipolar cell origin. GluR4-IR was restricted to dendrites of OFF-bipolar cells that innervated rod and cone terminals. NR2B-IR was restricted to a subtype of cone ON-bipolar cell. mGluR1-IR was restricted to ON mixed rod/cone (Mb) bipolar cells whose dendrites innervated rod and cone synaptic terminals.

Both GABA A and GABA B receptors are localised postsynaptically on neurons in the GP and SNr, and cannabinoid (CB 1) receptors are localised presynaptically on the axon terminals of the medium spiny projection neurons in the GP and SNr. The aims of this project were to investigate the changes in the distribution of CB 1, GABA A, and GABA B receptor subunits, as well as enkephalin and substance P in the GP in the HD brain compared to the normal brain. The results of this study have shown firstly, that in the HD brain there is a dramatic loss of enkephalin and CB 1 receptor immunoreactivity (IR) in the external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe) and a major loss of substance P and CB 1 receptor-IR from the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi). Secondly, the degeneration of these striatal efferent neurons results in the upregulation of the various subunits of both GABA A ( 1,  2,3 and  2) and GABA B (R 1) receptors in the GP in HD. Detailed double labelling confocal microscopy studies show that in HD the increased GABA A and GABA B receptor-IR is distributed not just in punctate synaptic regions, but throughout all dendritic and somal membranes of pallidal neurons. These results provide the first comprehensive description of the changes of CB 1, GABA A and GABA B receptor subunits in the HD basal ganglia. The upregulation of both GABA A and GABA B receptors may serve to increase the sensitivity of pallidal neurons to the decreased levels of GABA that occurs in the GP in HD. The loss of CB 1 receptors in HD is also thought to be a compensatory mechanism due to evidence that endocannabinoids modulate the reuptake of GABA in the GP. These findings show the high degree of plasticity of CB 1, GABA A and GABA B receptors and provide a better understanding of the GABAergic modulation of basal ganglia neurons in the normal and diseased human brain.",

GALP is known to stimulate both food intake and male-typical sex behavior, presumably by direct actions within the mPOA. Recent data from our and other labs have led us to suspect that GALP effects on sex behaviors are due to activation of incertohypothalamic dopaminergic neurons that terminate within the mPOA. To test the hypothesis that GALP activates mPOA dopaminergic systems, we utilized an immunolesion technique to eliminate dopaminergic fiber input to the mPOA via a dopamine transporter-specific toxin (DATSAP, n = 8) and compared to control injections (SAP, n = 8). All animals were sexually experienced adult male Long-Evans rats. DATSAP-treated male rats showed a significant ( p < 0.001) reduction in male sexual behaviors compared to SAP controls. We found that elimination of dopaminergic fibers within the mPOA significantly ( p < 0.001) eliminated all aspects of male sexual behavior under normal mating paradigms. Injections of GALP (5.0 nmol) significantly increased ( p < 0.01) male sex behavior and food intake in SAP control male rats but GALP did not stimulate the expression of these behaviors in DATSAP-treated rats. The orexigenic and anorexigenic effects of GALP were significantly ( p < 0.001) attenuated in DATSAP-treated male rats compared to SAP controls; however, ICV GALP was still able to significantly ( p < 0.05) reduce 24 h body weight in both DATSAP and SAP rats. ICV GALP significantly ( p < 0.05) stimulated fos within the mPOA of SAP rats but not in DATSAP-treated male rats.

Taken together, our results show the efficacy of CRF-TAMRA 1 as a novel tool for tracking CRF internalization into targets neurons in vivo and ultimately, aiding in elucidating the neuronal mechanisms and circuitry underlying CRF's influence on behavioral and physiological responses to stress.",

However, in the brain of opiate addicts, NADPHd and iNOS expression was detected in noradrenergic LC cells, correlating with an increase in iNOS and TNF- expression in glial cells as revealed by immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses.

Nitric oxide plays a wide range of functions in the nervous system generally by acting as a neurotransmitter-like molecule. It has been demonstrated that long-term treatments with estradiol in ovariectomized females and with testosterone in castrated males induce neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) expression in rat hypothalamus, whereas changes in nNOS immunoreactivity or in associated NADPH-diaphorase activity were observed both in hypothalamus and in amygdala during different phases of estrous cycle. Estradiol could induce nNOS expression in several brain regions in rodents. Therefore, to clarify if the hippocampal NO producing system is a target for gonadal hormones in physiological conditions, we have investigated the effects of estrous cycle in the expression of nNOS immunoreactivity on two-month-old intact female mice. Immunoreactive cells were observed in all hippocampal subregions: the higher number was detected in the pyramidal layer of CA1 region and in polymorph layer of dentate gyrus. The number of nNOS positive neurons fluctuates during the estrous cycle, reaching its peak during proestrus and metaestrus, and these variations were statistically significant in CA1, CA2 and CA3 regions. These results suggest that the nitrinergic system is a target for estrogen action in the hippocampus, and that this action may take place in physiological conditions according to the short-term variations of gonadal hormones during the estrous cycle.",

In addition, it is becoming clear that CCK is involved in regulating certain aspects of cardiovascular function. This article reviews the cardiovascular effects elicited by CCK via its actions at both central and peripheral sites and considers the physiological role of the peptide with respect to the cardiovascular function in different physiological and pathophysiological states. In the periphery CCK released from entoeroendocrine cells in the gut wall in response to a meal triggers a local postprandial hyperaemia in the gut that could promote digestion by facilitating intestinal motility and secretory processes. In addition, activation of CCK receptors on abdominal vagal afferents elicits a reflexly evoked hyperaemia that potentiates these effects and is also gasroprotective. In the brain CCK appears to act as a neuromodulator rather than a direct mediator within cardiovascular control circuits. In particular, it facilitates activity in amygdalar, hypothalamic and midbrain circuits that are involved in mediating acute cardiovascular and behavioural responses to an extreme physical or psychologically stressful challenge. Whilst in the short term activation of the CCK system appears to be beneficial to the organism, chronic stimulation of the system may be maladaptive, laying the foundation for the development of pathophysiological conditions such as panic disorder and chronic pain, both of which are states characterised by significant autonomic activation.",

Pharmacological and physiological data have shown that glutamate and NO may be linked in mediating cardiovascular regulation by the NTS. Through tract tracing, multiple-label immunofluorescent staining, confocal microscopic, and electronic microscopic methods, we and other investigators have provided anatomical evidence that supports a role for glutamate and NO as well as an interaction between glutamate and NO in cardiovascular regulation in the NTS. This review article focuses on summarizing and discussing these anatomical findings. We utilized antibodies to markers of glutamatergic neurons and to neuronal NO synthase (nNOS), the enzyme that synthesizes NO in NTS neurons, to study the anatomical relationship between glutamate and NO in rats. Not only were glutamatergic markers and nNOS both found in similar subregions of the NTS and in vagal afferents, they were also frequently colocalized in the same neurons and fibers in the NTS. In addition, glutamatergic markers and nNOS were often present in fibers that were in close apposition to each other. Furthermore, N-methyl- d-aspartate (NMDA) type glutamate receptors and nNOS were often found on the same NTS neurons. Similarly, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxozole-proprionic acid (AMPA) type glutamate receptors also frequently colocalized with nNOS in NTS neurons. These findings support the suggestion that the interaction between glutamate and NO may be mediated both through NMDA and AMPA receptors. Finally, by applying tracer to the cut aortic depressor nerve (ADN) to identify nodose ganglion (NG) neurons that transmit cardiovascular signals to the NTS, we observed colocalization of vesicular glutamate transporters (VGluT) and nNOS in the ADN neurons. Thus, taken together, these neuroanatomical data support the hypothesis that glutamate and NO may interact with each other to regulate cardiovascular and likely other visceral functions through the NTS.",

The cerebellar cortex was devoid of PrP immunoreactivity. The dorsal horn in the spinal cord was strongly immunoreactive.

The cDNA sequence of the pigeon GLT1 consisted of 1889 bp nucleotides and the amino acids showed 97% and 87% identity to the chicken and human GLT1, respectively. In situ hybridization autoradiograms revealed GLT1 mRNA expression in glial cells and produced regional differences of GLT1 mRNA distribution in CNS. GLT1 mRNA was expressed preferentially in the pallium than the subpallium. Moderate expression was seen in the hyperpallium, Field L, mesopallium, and hippocampal formation.

In the brainstem, the isthmic nuclei, optic tectum, vestibular nuclei, and cochlear nuclei expressed moderately, but the cerebellar cortex showed strong expression. Bergmann glial cells expressed GLT1 mRNA very strongly. The results indicate that cDNA sequence of the pigeon GLT1 is comparable with that of the mammalian GLT1, and a large number of GLT1 mRNA-expressing areas correspond with areas where AMPA-type glutamate receptors are located.

Therefore, to determine the contribution of each of the noradrenergic groups in W and in PS inhibition, rats were maintained in continuous W for 3 h in a novel environment or specifically deprived of PS for 3 days, with some of them allowed to recover from this deprivation. A double immunohistochemical labeling with Fos and tyrosine hydroxylase was then performed. Thirty percent of the LC noradrenergic cells were found to be Fos-positive after exposure to the novel environment and less than 2% after PS deprivation.

The PVN has at least three neural circuits to alter sympathetic activity and cardiovascular regulation. These pathways innervate the vasculature and organs such as the heart, kidney and adrenal medulla. The basal level of sympathetic tone at any given time is dependent upon excitatory and inhibitory inputs. Under normal circumstances the sympathetic nervous system is tonically inhibited. This inhibition is dependent upon GABA and nitric oxide such that nitric oxide potentiates local GABAergic synaptic inputs onto the neurones in the PVN. Excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate and angiotensin II modify the tonic inhibitory activity. The neurotransmitters oxytocin, vasopressin and dopamine have been shown to affect cardiovascular function. These neurotransmitters are found in neurones of the PVN and within the spinal cord. Oxytocin and vasopressin terminal fibres are closely associated with sympathetic preganglionic neurones (SPNs). Sympathetic preganglionic neurones have been shown to express receptors for oxytocin, vasopressin and dopamine. Oxytocin causes cardioacceleratory and pressor effects that are greatest in the upper thoracic cord while vasopressin cause these effects but more significant in the lower thoracic cord. Dopaminergic effects on the cardiovascular system include inhibitory or excitatory actions attributed to a direct PVN influence or via interneuronal connections to sympathetic preganglionic neurones.",

In rodents, direct photic stimuli reach the SCN mainly through the retinohypothalamic tract (RHT), whereas indirect photic stimuli are mainly conveyed by the geniculohypothalamic tract (GHT). In rodents, retinal cells form a pathway that reaches the intergeniculate leaflet (IGL) where they establish synapses with neurons that express neuropeptide Y (NPY), hence forming the GHT projecting to the SCN. In contrast to the RHT, which has been well described in primates, data regarding the presence or absence of the IGL and GHT in primates are contradictory. Some studies have suggested that an area of the pregeniculate nucleus (PGN) of primates might be homologous to the IGL of rodents, but additional anatomical and functional studies on primate species are necessary to confirm this hypothesis. Therefore, this study investigated the main histochemical characteristics of the PGN and the possible existence of the GHT in the SCN of the primate Cebus, comparing the distribution of NPY immunoreactivity, serotonin (5-HT) immunoreactivity and retinal terminal fibers in these two structures. The results show that a collection of cell bodies containing NPY and serotonergic immunoreactivity and retinal innervations are present within a zone that might be homologous to the IGL of rodents. The SCN also receives dense retinal innervations and we observed an atypical distribution of NPY- and 5-HT-immunoreactive fibers without regionalization in the ventral part of the nucleus as described for other species. These data may reflect morphological differences in the structures involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms among species and support the hypothesis that the GHT is present in some higher primates (diurnal animals).",

The InM sends monosynaptic projections to both the NTS and the hypoglossal nucleus. It is likely that the InM acts to integrate information from the head and neck and relays this information on to the NTS where suitable autonomic responses can be generated, and also to the hypoglossal nucleus to influence movements of the tongue and upper airways. Central to the integratory role of the InM is its neurochemical diversity. Neurones within the InM utilise the amino acid transmitters glutamate, GABA and glycine. A proportion of these excitatory and inhibitory neurones also use nitric oxide as a neurotransmitter. Peptidergic transmitters have also been found within InM neurones, although as yet the extent of the pattern of co-localisation between peptidergic and amino acid transmitters in neurones has not been established. The calcium binding proteins calretinin and parvalbumin are found within the InM in partially overlapping populations. Parvalbumin and calretinin appear to have complementary distributions within the InM, with parvalbumin being predominantly found within GABAergic neurones and calretinin being predominantly found within glutamatergic neurones. Neurones in the InM receive inputs from glutamatergic sensory afferents. This glutamatergic transmission is conducted through both NMDA and AMPA ionotropic glutamate receptors. In summary the InM contains a mixed pool of neurones including glutamatergic and GABAergic in addition to peptidergic neurones. Neurones within the InM receive inputs from the upper cervical region, descending inputs from brain regions involved in tongue movements and those involved in the co-ordination of the autonomic nervous system. Outputs from the InM to the NTS and hypoglossal nucleus suggest a possible role in the co-ordination of tongue movements and autonomic responses to changes in posture.",

ApoD expression has been shown to increase in several neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders, as well as during regeneration in the nervous system. Like ApoD, in the central nervous system somatostatin (SST) is widely present and functions as neurotransmitter and neuromodulator. The biological effects of SST are mediated via binding to five high-affinity G-protein coupled receptors termed SSTR15. Mice lacking ApoD exhibit reduced SST labeling in cortex and hippocampus and increased expression in striatum and amygdala without any noticeable changes in substantia nigra. Changes in SSTRs expressions have been described in several neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases. In the present study, using SSTR15 receptor-specific antibodies, we mapped their distribution in wild type ( w t ) and ApoD knockout (ApoD /) mouse brain. SSTR15 expression was observed both as membrane and cytoplasmic protein and display regions and receptor specific differences between w t and ApoD / mice brains. In cortex and hippocampus, SSTR subtypes like immunoreactivity are decreased in ApoD / mice brain. Unlike cortex and hippocampus, in the striatum of ApoD / mice, projection neurons showed increased SSTR immunoreactivity, as compared to w t . Higher SSTR subtypes immunoreactivity is seen in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) whereas lower in substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNpr) of ApoD / mice brains as compared to w t . Whereas, amygdala displayed SSTR subtypes changes in different nuclei of ApoD / mice in comparison to w t mice brain. Taken together, our results describe receptor and region specific changes in SST and SSTR subtypes expression in ApoD / mice brain, which may be linked to specific neurological disorders.",

Most of the neurons express individual enzymes of DA synthesis, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) or aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) and lack the DAT. A list of the neurons partly expressing the DA-ergic phenotype is not restricted to so-called monoenzymatic neurons, e.g. it includes some neurons co-expressing both enzymes of DA synthesis but lacking the DAT. In contrast to true DA-ergic neurons, monoenzymatic neurons and bienzymatic non-dopaminergic neurons lack the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) that raises a question about the mechanisms of storing and release of their final synthetic products. Monoenzymatic neurons are widely distributed all through the brain in adulthood being in some brain regions even more numerous than DA-ergic neurons. Individual enzymes of DA synthesis are expressed in these neurons continuously or transiently in norm or under certain physiological conditions. Monoenzymatic neurons, particularly those expressing TH, appear to be even more numerous and more widely distributed in the brain during ontogenesis than in adulthood. Most populations of monoenzymatic TH neurons decrease in number or even disappear by puberty. Functional significance of monoenzymatic neurons remained uncertain for a long time after their discovery. Nevertheless, it has been shown that most monoenzymatic TH neurons and AADC neurons are capable to produce l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) from l-tyrosine and DA from L-DOPA, respectively. L-DOPA produced in monoenzymatic TH neurons is assumed to play a role of a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator acting on target neurons via catecholamine receptors. Moreover, according to our hypothesis L-DOPA released from monoenzymatic TH neurons is captured by monoenzymatic AADC neurons for DA synthesis. Such cooperative synthesis of DA is considered as a compensatory reaction under a failure of DA-ergic neurons, e.g. in neurodegenerative diseases like hyperprolactinemia and Parkinson's disease.Thus, a substantial number of the brain neurons express partly the DA-ergic phenotype, mostly individual complementary enzymes of DA synthesis, serving to produce DA in cooperation that is supposed to be a compensatory reaction under the failure of DA-ergic neurons.",

However, the existence of an RMS within the adult human brain has been elusive. Immunohistochemical studies utilising cell-type specific markers for early progenitor cells (CD133), proliferating cells (PCNA), astrocytes and type B cells (GFAP) and migrating neuroblasts (PSA-NCAM), reveal that the adult human RMS is organized into layers containing glial cells, proliferating cells and neuroblasts. In addition, the RMS is arranged around a remnant of the ventricular cavity that extends from the SVZ to the OB as seen by immunohistological staining analysis and electron microscopy, showing the presence of basal bodies and a typical 9 + 2 arrangement of tubulin in tufts of cilia from all levels of the RMS. Overall, these findings suggest that a pathway of migratory progenitor cells similar to that seen in other mammals is present within the adult human brain and that this pathway could provide for neurogenesis in the human forebrain. These findings contribute to the scientific understanding of adult neurogenesis and establish the detailed cytoarchitecture of this novel neurogenic niche in the human brain.",

Compared to the room air condition, sustained hypoxia caused a significant increase in G protein activation in frontal association (FrA) region of the PFC. Region-specific comparisons revealed that intermittent and sustained hypoxia caused greater DAMGO-stimulated G protein activation in the FrA than in the pre-limbic (PrL).

Here we review previous literature relating to sites within the ventral medulla that have been identified as having a cardiovascular or respiratory function. Together with the maps generated here, of sites from which cardiovascular and respiratory responses were evoked by glutamate microinjection, specific cardiovascular regions have been defined and delineated. Commonly investigated regions, including the vasopressor rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) and vasodepressor caudal ventrolateral medulla (CVLM), or areas only described by others, such as the medullary cerebral vasodilator area, are included for completeness. Emphasis is given to the caudal medulla, where three pressor regions, the caudal pressor area (CPA), the intermediate pressor area (IPA) and the medullo-cervical pressor area (MCPA), caudal to the vasodepressor CVLM were defined in the original data provided. The IPA is most responsive under pentobarbitone rather than urethane anaesthesia clearly delineating it from both the rostrally located CPA and the caudally located MCPA. The description of these multiple pressor areas appears to clarify the confusion that surrounds the identification of the CPA. Also noted is a vasopressor region adjacent to the vasodepressor CVLM. Apart from the well described ventral respiratory column, a region medial to the pre-Botzinger is described, from which increases in both phrenic nerve frequency and amplitude were evoked. Limitations associated with the technique of glutamate microinjection to define functionally specific regions are discussed. Particular effort has been made to define and delineate the regions with respect to ventrally located anatomical landmarks rather than the commonly used ventral surface or dorsal landmarks such as the obex or calamus scriptorius that may vary with the brain orientation or histological processing. This should ensure that a region can easily be defined by all investigators.

Knockdown of GPBP leads to loss of myelinated tracts in the central nervous system and to extensive apoptosis in the brain during early embryogenesis. GPBP was initially identified as a protein associated with the autoantigen in Goodpasture autoimmune syndrome, where it was shown to be a kinase that regulates type IV collagen organization. GPBP isoforms bind and transport ceramide from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus and are therefore also known as ceramide transporters (CERT). Ceramide dysregulation is involved in autoimmunity and neurodegenerative disorders. In order to analyze the possible role of GPBP in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration we studied the basal GPBP expression in normal rat brain. High levels of immunoreactivity were detected in neurons of the cerebral cortex, hippocampal formation, the basal ganglia, the olfactory bulb and nuclei of the thalamus, the hypothalamus and the septal area. Lower expression levels of GPBP were observed widely throughout the brain, suggesting that GPBP plays an important role in central nervous system neuron function.",

Earlier studies have localized the endogenous opioids, met- and leu-enkephalin, in the song control regions of male zebra finches ( Taenopygia guttata), a sexually dimorphic species of songbirds wherein only males sing. Recent research has shown that levels of enkephalin increase in some of the song control regions during singing and that blocking opioid receptors with the antagonist naloxone decreases the frequency of singing in songbirds. However, the distribution of receptors specific to the opioid system has not been studied in zebra finches. In the present study, we used reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) to demonstrate that the song control regions lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium (LMAN), Area X, MSt (medial striatum), HVC and RA (robust nucleus of the arcopallium) expressed higher levels of -OR mRNA compared to -OR mRNA. In situ hybridization was used to demonstrate that neither LMAN nor Area X could be delineated from the surrounding brain regions [anterior nidopallium (ANP) and MSt, respectively], based on OR mRNA expression. However, HVC and RA neurons expressed marginally higher levels of -OR mRNA compared to the posterior nidopallium, which was confirmed by immunohistochemical localization. We also found that the dorsolateral subdivision of DLM (dorsolateral nucleus of the medial thalamus) demonstrated high levels of -OR immunoreactivity.

All sympathetic outflow to the periphery comes from SPN, which send their axons from thoracic and upper lumbar spinal segments to innervate post-ganglionic neurons in sympathetic ganglia and chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla. Despite over 30 years of study, we still do not have a sufficiently detailed understanding of the synaptic circuits through which these important neurons receive information from other central sites. We know that there is direct synaptic input to SPN from both supraspinal and intraspinal neurons, but not sensory neurons. Ultrastructural studies support functional evidence that amino acids are the primary fast-acting transmitters controlling SPN activity and indicate that an amino acid transmitter occurs in every synaptic input to an SPN. In addition, axons that synapse on SPN contain neuropeptides and monoamines, which would co-exist with and be released with the amino acids. Receptors and transporters for transmitters have also been localized in SPN inputs. Light and electron microscopic observations suggest that there are qualitative and/or quantitative differences in the neurochemical types and origins of axons, which provide synaptic input to SPN that supply different targets or have different functions. However, more research is required before it can be confirmed that SPN receive projection- or function-specific patterns of innervation. This information is likely to be important if we are to understand how the central nervous system differentially regulates sympathetic outflow to different target tissues.",

When brain temperature peaked or reached a level suggestive of possible lethality (>41.5 C), rats were injected with Evans blue (EB), rapidly anesthetized, perfused, and their brains were taken for further analyses. Four brain areas (cortex, hippocampus, thalamus and hypothalamus) were analyzed for EB extravasation, water and electrolyte (Na +, K +, Cl ) contents, immunostained for albumin and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and examined for neuronal, glial and axonal alterations using standard light and electron microscopy. These examinations revealed profound abnormalities in neuronal, glial, and endothelial cells, which were stronger with METH administered at 29 C than 23 C and tightly correlated with brain and body hyperthermia. These changes had some structural specificity, but in each structure they tightly correlated with increases in EB levels, the numbers of albumin-positive cells, and water and ion contents, suggesting leakage of the BBB, acutely developing brain edema, and serious shifts in brain ion homeostasis as leading factors underlying brain abnormalities.

A plethora of evidence supports a role for the hormone within the central nervous system in modulating the pathways regulating cardiovascular function. A complex interaction of several brainstem, spinal and forebrain nuclei is required to receive, integrate and co-ordinate inputs that contribute appropriate autonomic reflex responses to changes in blood pressure and other cardiovascular parameters. Central effects of oestrogen and oestrogen receptors have already been demonstrated in many of these areas. In addition to the classical nuclear oestrogen receptors (ER and ER) a recently discovered G-protein coupled receptor, GPR30, has been shown to be a novel mediator of oestrogenic action. Many anatomical and molecular studies have described a considerable overlap in the regional expression of these receptors; however, the receptors do exhibit specific characteristics and subtype specific expression is found in many autonomic brain areas, for example ER appears to predominate in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, whilst ER is important in the nucleus of the solitary tract.

Western immunoblot analysis of SREBP-2 showed a dense band at 70 kDa corresponding to the transcriptionally active form of SREBP-2 in homogenates from the rat hippocampus, cortex and striatum. SREBP-2 immunolabeled sections showed dense labeling of pyramidal neurons in field CA1 and CA3 of the hippocampus, moderately dense labeling of pyramidal and non-pyramidal neurons of the cerebral neocortex, and moderate labeling of putative medium spiny neurons in the caudate nucleus and putamen. Label was observed in the somatic cytoplasm, nucleus and apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons, and dendritic shafts and spines in the neuropil in the hippocampus. The expression of SREBP-2 was also elucidated after excitotoxic neuronal injury induced by intracerebroventricular injections of kainate. Real time RT-PCR analyses showed that mRNA level of SREBP-2 was significantly reduced at both 1 day and 2 weeks post-kainate injection. Immunohistochemical analyses showed significantly reduced SREBP-2 immunoreactivity in the kainate-induced lesions, in support of the real time RT-PCR results.

In this study, neurochemical features and topography of VGLUT3-containing cell bodies and axons in the DR were examined. Since many 5-HT cells have been reported to express VGLUT3, the distribution of dually labeled axons was examined within the DR. Axons containing both VGLUT3 and 5-HT immunolabeling had a topographic distribution: they innervated the ependyma and ramified within the caudal DR at the base of the aqueduct, an area known to give rise to ependymal innervation. Thus VGLUT3 is only present in a specific subcomponent of recurrent 5-HT axon collaterals. Remaining VGLUT3 axons were only rarely dually immunolabeled for markers of monoamines, GABA, or acetycholine, suggesting these axons contain a predominance of glutamate-filled vesicles. Since the substance P receptor, neurokinin 1 (NK1), has previously been associated with local glutamate neurons in the DR, the relationship between NK1, 5-HT and VGLUT3 cells was examined using triple-immunolabeling.

From E16.5 through P28, the majority of CB+ neurons and virtually all PV+ neurons are GABAergic. However, after P10, the percentage of GABAergic CB+ cells decline from 96% to 70%. Furthermore, while only 9% of CB+ neurons are PV+ at P10, this percentage raises to 42% at P28.

Comparisons of the cells labeled with CR and with more general olfactory markers (acetylated tubulin and keyhole limpet haemocyanin) in alevins and fry revealed that CR-ir cells represent only a subpopulation of olfactory receptor cells. Large cells located in the primordial mitral cell layer were the first CR-ir neuronal population of the olfactory bulbs and were observed in 7-mm embryos.

In both species, most Purkinje cells were calbindin-immunoreactive, while calretinin and parvalbumin were expressed in a small portion of Purkinje cells. In addition, calretinin-immunoreactive unipolar brush and granule cells and calbindin- and parvalbumin-immunoreactive basket, stellate, and Golgi cells were observed. Calretinin-immunoreactive corticopetal (mossy and climbing) fibers were found. Based on the length of the primary dendrite, short-, middle-, and long-dendrite unipolar brush cells could be distinguished. The validity of this classification was supported using cluster analysis suggesting the presence of several natural types of these cells. The distribution of Ca 2+-binding proteins in the cerebellar cortex of the cetaceans studied was generally similar to that reported for terrestrial mammals, suggesting that this trait is evolutionarily conservative in mammals.",

We used receptor autoradiography and [ 3H]MK801, [ 3H]AMPA, [ 3H]pirenzepine and [ 3H]AFDX384 to target glutamate NMDA, glutamate AMPA and muscarinic M1 and M2 receptors, respectively. The major outcome from the present study was an overall decrease in levels of the glutamate AMPA receptor density ( F = 14.5, d.f. = 1, p < 0.001) in the PCP treated rats. More specifically, PCP-treated animals displayed decreased AMPA receptor density in hippocampus CA1 (16%), hippocampus CA2 (25%), dentate gyrus (27%), parietal cortex layers IIIVI (19%), central nucleus of the amygdala (40%), and basolateral amygdala (19%). Other brain regions examined were unaffected. PCP administration did not significantly affect glutamate NMDA, muscarinic M1 and M2 receptor density.

SLNC of the rat sciatic nerve induces pain-related behaviors, as well as changes in the expression of neuropeptide tyrosine and the Y 1 receptor in lumbar dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) and spinal cord. In the present study, we have analyzed the expression of another neuropeptide, galanin, in lumbar DRGs and spinal cord after different degrees of constriction of the rat sciatic nerve. The nerve was ligated and reduced to 1030, 4080 or 90% of its original diameter (light, medium or strong SLNCs). At different times after injury (7, 14, 30, 60 days), lumbar 4 and 5 DRGs and the corresponding levels of the spinal cord were dissected out and processed for galanin-immunohistochemistry. In DRGs, SLNC induced a gradual increase in the number of galanin-immunoreactive (IR) neurons, in direct correlation with the degree of constriction. Thus, after light SLNC, a modest upregulation of galanin was observed, mainly in small-sized neurons. However, following medium or strong SLNCs, there was a more drastic increase in the number of galanin-IR neurons, involving also medium and large-sized cells. The highest numbers of galanin-IR neurons were detected 14 days after injury. In the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, medium and strong SLNCs induced a marked ipsilateral increase in galanin-like immunoreactivity in laminae III. These results show that galanin expression in DRGs and spinal cord is differentially regulated by different degrees of nerve constriction and further support its modulatory role on neuropathic pain.",

Real-time PCR and Western blot analysis were used to detect the spatio-temporal expression of -1,4-GalT-I after SCI. Lectin-fluorescent staining with RCA-I was used to detect the galactosylation of the membrane glycoproteins. The interaction and colocalization between -1,4-GalT-I and E-selectin in the injured spinal cords were also assessed by immunoprecipitation of E-selectin and double immunofluorescent staining, respectively. Real-time PCR revealed that -1,4-GalT-I mRNA reached the peak at 1 d after spinal cord contusion. In situ hybridization indicated that -1,4-GalT-I mRNA was mainly distributed in the local inflammatory cells, adjacent to the center of injury. Double immunofluorescent staining showed that -1,4-GalT-I mostly overlapped with ED1-positive macrophages 1 d after SCI, partly colocalized with microglia, neutrophils and a few with oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. The result of Lectin-fluorescent staining with RCA-I was similar to that of double immunofluorescent staining. Terminal galactosylation of E-selectin underwent obvious changes between sham and 3 d after SCI by immunoprecipitation of E-selectin.

Our results revealed that neurons of both divisions were poor in GluR1. The vND, the GluR2/3+ and GluR4+ label presented no area or neuronal size preference, although most neurons were around 75%. The dND neurons expressing GluR2/3 are primarily around 85%, medium to large-sized 85%, and predominantly 60% located in the medial portion of the rostral pole and in the lateral portion of the caudal pole. The majority of dND neurons containing GluR4 are also around 75%, larger (70% are large and giant), exhibiting a distribution that seems to be complementary to that of GluR2/3+ neurons. This distinct arrangement indicates functional differences into and between the DC nuclei, also signaling that such variation could be attributed to the diverse nature of the subunit composition of the GluRs.

To further determine species differences, we examined the sensory-input dependency of occ1/ Frp mRNA expression in mice in comparison with macaque V1. In macaque V1, occ1/ Frp mRNA expression level significantly decreased with even 1-day monocular deprivation (MD) by TTX injection. In contrast to that in macaques, however, the occ1/ Frp mRNA expression in the visual cortex in mice was not down-regulated by 1- to 7-day MD by TTX injection. Similarly, MD had no effect on occ1/ Frp mRNA expression level in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus of mice. In addition, the extirpation of the cochlear or olfactory epithelium had no effect on occ1/ Frp mRNA expression in either the cochlear nucleus or the olfactory bulb in mice. Thus, occ1/ Frp mRNA expression is independent of sensory-input in mice. The results suggest that activity-dependent occ1/ Frp mRNA expression is not common between mice and monkeys, and that primate V1 has acquired a unique gene regulatory mechanism that enables a rapid response to environmental changes.

Despite of the fact, that these two mammalian species are not closely related, principal cell types in the CN of the two species showed many corresponding morphological features and similarities in immunolabeling of the CaBPs. Parvalbumin seems not to be suited as a differential neuronal marker in the CN since it is expressed by almost all neurons. In contrast, calbindin and calretinin were more restricted to specific cell types and showed a mostly complementary labeling pattern. As one of the most interesting findings, calbindin and calretinin were predominantly found in subpopulations of globular bushy cells and octopus cells in the ventral CN. Such a neuron-specific CaBP-expression in subpopulations of morphologically defined cell types argues for a more refined classification of CN cell types in Meriones and Monodelphis. Additionally, other cell types (cartwheel cells, unipolar brush cells, fusiform cells) were marked with calbindin or calretinin as well. Calretinin staining was predominantly observed in auditory nerve fibers and their endings including endbulbs of Held in Meriones.

Immunoreactivity for GABA, glycine and serotonin was found at early metamorphic stages, while expression of the markers of catecholaminergic amacrine cells, dopamine and tyrosine hydroxylase, was found to be delayed until intermediate metamorphic stages. GABA, which is found in some amacrine and horizontal cells of adults, was first observed in amacrine cells during early stages of transformation and then in horizontal cells during middle stages.

Here, we have conducted an electron microscopic examination of the subcellular distribution of the 5-HT 1BR, NMDA receptor subunit NR1 and neurotransmitter -aminobutyric acid (GABA), within the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Ultrastructurally, 18% of 5-HT 1BR immunoreactivity was pre-synaptic (within axons and axon terminals), and 65% post-synaptic (within dendrites and dendritic spines); no significant differences were found between molecular layer subdivisions. Post-synaptic labelling was cytoplasmic and membranous. Spinous labelling was more frequently bound to the plasma membrane, but not usually directly associated with the synaptic specialisation. Only 16% of 5-HT 1BR positive profiles displayed NR1 labelling, of which most were dendrites, at a slightly higher level within the inner, compared to middle and outer molecular layer divisions. 5-HT 1BR labelled profiles rarely showed labelling for GABA.

We found evidence for serotonergic neurons in three regions of the brain, including the diencephalon, rostral and caudal brainstem, as previously reported in several other species of reptile. Within the diencephalon we found neurons in the periventricular organ of the hypothalamus, but not in the infundibular recess as noted in some other reptilian species. In addition we found serotonergic neurons in the pretectal nucleus, this being the first description of these neurons in any species. Within the rostral brainstem we found medial and lateral divisions of the superior raphe nucleus and a widely dispersed group of neurons in the tegmentum, the superior reticular nucleus. In the caudal brainstem we observed the inferior raphe nucleus and the inferior reticular nucleus. While much of the serotonergic system of the Nile crocodile is similar to that seen in other reptiles the entire suite of features appears to distinguish the crocodile studied from the members of the Squamate (lizards and snakes) and Testudine (turtles, tortoises and terrapins) reptiles previously studied. The observations are suggestive of order-specific patterns of nuclear organization of this system in the reptiles, reflecting potential evolutionary constraints in the mutability of the nuclear organization as seen for similar systems in mammals.",

In order to help understanding the physiological role of neuronal OMgp, we examined the change of OMgp expression in the facial nucleus after the facial nerve transection. Real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis showed a down-regulation of OMgp expression in the facial nucleus 57 (mRNA) or 514 (protein) days after transection. Thereafter, expression of OMgp returned to the control level at 28 days after axotomy. Subsequent analysis using in situ hybridization histochemistry and immunohistochemistry established that the decrease of OMgp expression was attributable to the expression in facial motoneurons, but not in oligodendrocytes. These findings suggest a possibility that the change of neuronal OMgp expression might be involved in reconnection of neural circuit between axotomized facial neuron and upper motor neuron after transection.",

Control animals exhibited weak mRNA expression in the VB, Po and CM/CL, as well as in PCRt, while moderate grain densities were observed in the Rt, DRt and LRt. During MA, DOR mRNA expression was significantly decreased (22%) in the Rt contralateral to the affected joint at both 7 and 14 days of inflammation, as compared to controls. A bilateral reduction (35%) was also observed in the DRt at 14 days of MA, while a contralateral increase was found in the PCRt at 7 days (+39%).

The greater canerat was chosen for investigation as it is a large rodent (around 2.7 kg body mass) and has an average brain mass of 13.75 g, more than five times larger than that of the laboratory rat. The greater canerats used in the present study were caught from the wild, which is again another contrast to the laboratory rat. While these differences, especially that of size, may lead to the prediction of significant differences in the nuclear complement of these systems, we found that all nuclei identified in both systems in the laboratory rat and other rodents in several earlier studies had direct homologs in the brain of the greater canerat. Moreover, there were no additional nuclei in the brain of the greater canerat that are not found in the laboratory rat or other rodents. It is noted that the locus coeruleus of the laboratory rat differs in appearance to that reported for several other rodent species.

In tissue from the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum all subtype mRNAs were detected, but sst5 signals were weak, and the distribution of sst1sst5 immunoreactivities was consistent with previous reports. In the medulla, all sst mRNAs gave clear amplicons and subtype-specific antibodies produced characteristic patterns of immunolabelling, frequently in areas of somatostatinergic innervation. Anti-sst1 labelled beaded fibres, sst2 A, sst2 B, sst4 and sst5 gave somatodendritic labelling and sst3 labelled presumptive neuronal cilia. In NTS tissue, sst1, sst2 A, sst4 and sst5 mRNAs were strongly expressed, while in VLM tissue sst1, sst2 A, sst2 B and sst4 predominated. In both areas of the medulla, neurones with intense somatodendritic sst2 A immunoreactivity were principally catecholaminergic in phenotype, being double labelled for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and phenylethanolamine- N-methyl-transferase (PNMT). Some TH/PNMT positive neurones were also sst2 B and sst4 immunoreactive. Cholinergic parasympathetic neurones in the DVN were immunoreactive for the sst2 A, sst2 B, sst4 and sst5 subtypes.

Inherent to this technique, however, is the notable basal signal evident in several brain regions in the absence of receptor stimulation by exogenously added agonist. In the rat brain, much of this basal labelling derives from tonic activation of adenosine A 1 and lysophosphatidic acid LPA 1 receptors in the gray and white matter regions, respectively. Despite the elimination of the two receptor activities, prominent basal [ 35S]GTPS labelling is still evident in discrete brain structures, possibly reflecting regional enrichment of G i/o and/or constitutive receptor activity or the presence of still unknown endogenous ligands activating their orphan receptors. Here, the anatomical distribution of the enhanced basal signal was systematically mapped in brain sections of 4-week-old male Wistar rats. Regions with prominent basal [ 35S]GTPS labelling represented neuroanatomically distinct structures, in particular various thalamic and hypothalamic nuclei. For instance, the paraventricular thalamic nucleus, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and the subfornical organ were highly labelled, as were the periaqueductal gray and the nucleus of the solitary tract. Pre-treatment with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), an alkylating agent preventing all known receptor-driven G protein activity in cryostat sections markedly decreased the basal binding in all examined regions.

The rats were exposed continuously to a simulated high altitude of 6100 m for 3, 7, 14 and 21 days in an animal decompression chamber. Spatial reference memory was tested by Morris water maze. The oxidative stress markers like free radicals, NO, lipid peroxidation, LDH activity and antioxidant systems like GSH, GSSG, GPx, GR, SOD were estimated from cortex, hippocampus and striatum. The morphological changes, neurodegeneration, DNA fragmentation and mode of cell death have also been studied. It was observed that the spatial reference memory was significantly affected after exposure to hypobaric hypoxia. Increased oxidative stress markers along with decreased effectiveness of antioxidant system were also observed in hypoxia-exposed animals. Further pyknotic, shrunken, tangle-like neurons were observed in all these regions after hypoxia and neurodegeneration, DNA fragmentation and apoptosis were also observed in all the three regions. But after 21 days of exposure, the spatial memory was improved along with improvement of antioxidant activities. Our result suggests that the apoptotic death may be involved in HA-induced memory impairment and after 7 days of exposure the effect was more pronounced but after 21 days of exposure recovery was observed.",

And Dexras1, a small G protein mediating multiple signal transductions, has been reported to form a complex with CAPON and nNOS. A role for the physiologic linkage by CAPON of nNOS to Dexras1 has suggested that NO-mediated activation of Dexras1 is markedly enhanced by CAPON. We investigated the changes in mRNA for CAPON, Dexras1 and nNOS in the sciatic nerve, dorsal root ganglia and lumbar spinal cord of adult rat following sciatic axotomy by TaqMan quantitative real-time PCR and in situ hybridization combined with immunofluorescence. Signals of mRNA for CAPON and Dexras1 were initially expressed in these neural tissues mentioned, transiently increased at certain time periods after sciatic axotomy and finally recovered to the basal level. It was also found that nNOS mRNA underwent a similar change pattern during this process. These results suggest that CAPON as well as Dexras1 may be involved in the different pathological conditions including nerve regeneration, neuron loss or survival and even pain process, possibly via regulating the nNOS activity or through the downstream targets of Dexras1.",

Regarding to M2-MRs, we showed that: at PD21, MeHg-treated animals did not display any differences compared to controls, while, at PD36 there was a significant increase of M2-immunopositive Bergmann cells in the molecular layer (ML), suggesting a MeHg-related cytotoxic effect. Similarly to M2-MRs, at PD21 the M3-MRs were not affected by MeHg, while, at PD36 a lacking immunoreactivity of the granular layer (IGL) was observed after MeHg treatment. In MeHg-treated rats, at both developmental points, we showed reactive gliosis, e.g. a significant increase in Bergmann glia of the ML and astrocytes of the IGL, identified by their expression of glial fibrillar acidic protein. No MeHg-related effects on Purkinje cells were detected neither at weaning nor at puberty. These findings suggest: (i) a delayed MeHg exposure-related effect on M2- and M3-MRs, (ii) an overt MeHg-related cytotoxic effect on cerebellar oligodendroglia, e.g. reactive gliosis, (iii) a selective vulnerability of granule cells and Purkinje neurons to MeHg, with the latter that remain unharmed.",

In the present study, GABAergic neuronal organization was analyzed in relation to the location of subnuclei in the mouse cNTS. According to the differential expression of glutamate decarboxylase 67 (GAD67), vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2), calbindin, and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNAs, the cNTS was divided into four subnuclei: the subpostrema, dorsomedial, commissural, and medial subnuclei. The numerical density and size of soma in the four subnuclei were then quantified by an unbiased disector analysis. Calbindin-positive cells constituted subpopulations of small non-GABAergic neurons preferentially localized in the subpostrema subnucleus. TH-positive cells constituted large neurons preferentially localized in the medial subnucleus. GABAergic neurons constituted a subpopulation of small neurons, preferentially localized in the commissural and medial subnuclei, which represented 50% of small cells in these subnuclei. Thus, the GABAergic small neurons were located around TH-positive large cells in the ventrolateral portion of the cNTS. This finding, in combination with results of previous studies in the rat cNTS showing that large cells originate efferents from the cNTS, suggests that GABAergic small neurons in the commissural and medial subnuclei might regulate output from the cNTS.",

However, no activation of the efficacy of D 2 receptor coupling to G-protein could be measured in these and other brain regions. Binding to DAT was unchanged throughout brain. Because of their implication in cocaine addiction, the functionality of -opioid and GABA B receptors was also assessed by [ 35S]GTPS autoradiography. 5-HT 1B KO showed selective decreases in G-protein coupling to -opioid receptors in the paraventricular thalamic nucleus, and to GABA B receptors in the basolateral nucleus of amygdala.

The number of striatal dopaminergic neurons, visualized with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunohistochemistry, was measured in three groups of cynomolgus ( Macaca fascicularis) monkeys: (1) normal untreated monkeys; (2) monkeys rendered parkinsonian following systemic injection of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), but otherwise untreated; and (3) MPTP-intoxicated monkeys that received oral l-dopa on a chronic basis. In agreement with previous studies, the number of striatal TH-positive (TH+) neurons in l-dopa-free parkinsonian monkeys was significantly higher ( p < 0.05) than in normal (non-parkinsonian) monkeys. However, this increase was abolished in parkinsonian monkeys that received l-dopa treatment. In fact, the number of striatal TH+ neurons in l-dopa-treated parkinsonian monkeys was not significantly different ( p > 0.05) from values obtained in normal monkeys. These findings suggest that the DA concentration regulates the numerical density of this ectopic neuronal population, a phenomenon that is more likely the result of a shift in the phenotype of preexistent striatal interneurons rather than the recruitment of newborn neurons that would eventually develop a DA phenotype. Our data also reinforce the hypothesis that striatal TH+ neurons act as local DA source and, as such, are part of a compensatory mechanism that could be artificially enhanced to alleviate or delay PD symptoms.",

For this purpose, we have combined dual in situ hybridization to detect both VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 mRNAs together with retrograde tracing with cholera toxin. Our results show that VGLUT2 is the only vesicular glutamate transporter expressed in thalamostriatal-projecting neurons located in the midline and intralaminar nuclei, whereas all neurons from the ventral thalamic nuclei innervating the striatum express both VGLUTs, at least at the mRNA level. Indeed, the mRNAs encoding for VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 displayed a sharp complementary subcellular distribution within neurons from the ventral thalamic nuclei giving rise to thalamostriatal projections. The differential distribution of VGLUT mRNAs lead us to conclude that the thalamostriatal pathway is a dual system, composed by a preponderant projection arising from the midline and intralaminar nuclei using VGLUT2 as the glutamate transporter, together with another important source of striatal afferents arising from neurons in the ventral thalamic relay nuclei containing both kinds of vesicular glutamate transporters.",

We recently showed a loss of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) protein in the olfactory bulb of reeler mutants and advanced the hypothesis that the Reelin and NO signalling pathways may influence each other. We now studied the distribution of NO sensitive guanylyl cyclase (NOsGC), Reelin and its receptor Apolipoprotein E2 (ApoEr2) in the olfactory bulb by multiple fluorescence labelling and tested whether nNOS and ApoEr2 colocalize in this area. We also essayed the protein content of NOsGC in the reeler olfactory bulb and tested whether there are any changes in nNOS and NOsGC protein in other reeler brain areas. Olfactory bulb interneurons expressing ApoEr2 and nNOS are only few in the glomerular layer but represent the large majority of granule cell layer interneurons. Conversely, NOsGC interneurons are rare in the granule cell layer and abundant as periglomerular cells. Reelin containing periglomerular cells almost entirely belong to the NOsGC subset. These data further support the hypothesis of a reciprocal signalling between Reelin/NOsGC and ApoEr2/nNOS expressing neurons to affect olfactory bulb activity. We also show that a significant rise in NOsGC content accompanies the decrease of nNOS protein in the reeler olfactory bulb. The same reciprocal changes present in the cortex/striatum and the hippocampus of reeler mice. Thus, the influence that the deficit of extracellular Reelin seems to exert on nNOS and its receptor is not limited to the olfactory bulb but is a general feature of the reeler brain.",

The results revealed that sbER transactivates promoters containing estradiol responsive elements (ERE) in a doseresponse manner. The sbER showed the highest affinity for 17--estradiol. In situ hybridization studies demonstrated that ER mRNA positive neurons are widely distributed within the sea bass brain, including the telencephalon, preoptic area, thalamus, hypothalamus, mesencephalic tectum and tegmentum and rhombencephalon. New estrogen dependent nuclei were described in all above areas. The sbER was profusely expressed in the main neuroendocrine areas such as the preoptic area and hypothalamus, thus suggesting the steroidal modulation of the hypophysiotropic neurons.

Thereafter, the levels of NGF and BDNF were transiently elevated while NT-3 level continuously increased and recovered to normal level at 30 dpo. In the contralateral precentral gyrus (cPG), only the NT-3 level was altered and in fact elevated above the normal value. No obvious changes were observed in NT-4 level in any of the regions studied. Taken together, the present findings indicated that intrinsic NGF, BDNF and NT-3 may play a local role in the responses to the SCI in primates.

Double labeling for TRH and tyrosine hydroxylase, the main catecholamine marker, was made to help the correct localization of the labeled structures and to evaluate the possible interaction of these two systems. Cells containing TRH were found in the hypothalamic paraventricular and periventricular nuclei and their projections to the median eminence were corroborated. In addition, with some species variation, extrahypothalamic cells were present in the medial amygdala, mesencephalic tegmentum, descending vestibular nucleus and in the retina. Fiber labeling was observed in all main brain subdivisions but was more abundant in regions such as the striatum, septum, amygdaloid complex, dorsal thalamus and tegmento-reticular zones. Actual colocalization of TRH and catecholamines in the same neurons was not observed but the codistribution of cells and fibers labeled for TRH and tyrosine hydroxylase strongly suggests that they can interact in diverse regions, not only in the hypothalamohypophysial system.

In socially isolated nVH-lesion rats decrease in dendritic length in PFC and NAcc neurons were exacerbated whereas an increase in spine density of medium spiny neurons was observed in the NAcc.

Many features of the Monodelphis opossum thalamus resemble those in Didelphis and small eutherians showing no particular sensory specializations, particularly in small murid rodents. However, several features of thalamic organization in Monodelphis were distinct from those in rodents. In the opossum the anterior and midline nuclear groups are more clearly separated from adjacent structures than in eutherians. The dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGNd) starts more rostrally and occupies a large part of the lateral wall of the thalamus. As in other marsupials, two cytoarchitectonically different parts, alpha and beta are discernible in the LGNd of the opossum. Each of them may be subdivided into two additional bands in acetylcholinesterase staining, while in murid rodents the LGNd consists of a homogeneous mass of cells. Therefore, differentiation of the LGNd of the Monodelphis opossum is more advanced than in murid rodents. The medial geniculate body consists of three nuclei (medial, dorsal and ventral) that are cytoarchitectonically distinct and stain differentially for parvalbumin.

Experiments were carried out on 10 prepubertal (17 weeks old) and 10 peripubertal (32 weeks old) ovary-intact lambs. Morphofunctional changes in the somatostatin neurons were assayed with immunohistochemistry and hybridisation in situ. Computer image analysis was used to determine the density of both reactions and the percentage of the area exhibiting immunohistochemical staining. These parameters express the content of immunoreactive (ir) somatostatin and expression of mRNA for pre-pro-somatostatin (PPS). Two populations of ir somatostatin perikarya were localized in the hypothalamus: a very large number of perikarya in the periventricular (PEV) nucleus, and single cell bodies in the arcuate (ARC) nucleus. Only ir somatostatin fibres, but no perikarya were seen in the ventromedial (VM) nucleus and preoptic area. The analysis of mRNA PPS showed perikarya filled with silver grains localized in the PEV, ARC and VM. There were differences in the content of ir somatostatin and the intensity of the PPS mRNA signal between the two periods investigated. In the median eminence, the content of ir somatostatin in the terminals decreased in the peripubertal compared to the prepubertal group ( P < 0.001). In the PEV, the content of ir somatostatin in the perikarya and the expression of PPS mRNA decreased in the peripubertal compared to the prepubertal group ( P < 0.001). In the ARC, the content of ir somatostatin in the perikarya increased ( P < 0.001), but expression of PPS mRNA decreased ( P < 0.001) in the peripubertal compared to the prepubertal group.

Treatment with MCH increases food intake, and MCH mRNA is overexpressed in leptin-deficient ( ob/ ob) mice.

Dense MCH innervation of the cerebral motor cortex (MCx) and the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPT), both related to motor function, has been reported. Therefore, we postulated that a specific group of MCH neurons project to these areas.

We found that 25% of the LHA neurons projecting to the PPT were immunoreactive for MCH, and that 75% of the LHA neurons projecting to the MCx also contained MCH. Few MCH neurons were found to send collaterals to both areas. We also found that 15% of the incerto-hypothalamic neurons projecting to the PPT expressed MCH immunoreactivity. Those neurons preferentially innervated the rostral PPT. In addition, we observed that the MCH neurons express glutamic acid decarboxylase mRNA, a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) synthesizing enzyme.

However, the influence exerted by 5-HT on GABA synthesis remains poorly understood. The major pathway for GABA synthesis is the enzymatic decarboxylation of glutamate by glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) 65 and 67. In the present research, western blotting results show a time- and dose-dependent enhancement of GAD65 and GAD67 expression induced by 5-HT treatment and a concentration of 100 nM 5-HT applied for 3 days is shown to be the optimal condition for maximal expression of GAD67 and a significant expression of GAD65. Under the stimulation of such 5-HT application the phosphorylation of Akt and p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase is activated and specifically blocked by inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) (LY294002) or the p42/p44 MAP kinase (PD98059 and U0126) pathways. Moreover, LY294002, or PD98059, or U0126 partially inhibit 5-HT-stimulated increases in GAD67 or GAD65 expression. Further, 5-HT application has no effect on the number of GAD65/GAD67-immunopositive neuronal cells; but it can induce an increase in the total area, process length and number of primary neurites of GAD65/67-positive neurons, an increase that appears to involve LY294002 and PD98059.

In contrast, TIP39-ir neurons were detectable in the MPL at embryonic day 14.5 (ED-14.5), and the intensity of their labeling increased thereafter. We also identified TIP39-ir neurons between ED-16.5 and PND-5 in two additional brain areas, the PIL and the amygdalo-hippocampal transitional zone (AHi).

Thus, in the LS, a separate population of neurons is covered by VGLUT3-ir PBs. The distribution pattern and the lack of co-localization indicate that the VGLUT3-expressing cells of origin are located in the brainstem and that they could be pure glutamatergic projection neuronsdifferent from the well-defined canonical VGLUT1- and VGLUT2-expressing neurons. Alternatively, they could simultaneously express VGLUT3 and second transmitter, but use different release sites inside the LS for both.",

The object of this investigation was to examine the terminal distribution of nonserotonergic DRN projections in the basal forebrain and extended amygdala, using a technique that allows selective anterograde tracing of nonserotonergic DRN projections. To trace nonserotonergic DRN projections, animals were pretreated with nomifensine, desipramine and the serotonergic neurotoxin 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT), 7 days prior to placing an iontophoretic injection of biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) into the DRN. In animals treated with 5,7-DHT, numerous nonserotonergic BDA-labeled fibers ascended to the basal forebrain in the medial forebrain bundle system. Some of these labeled fibers crossed through the lateral hypothalamus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and substantial innominata. These fibers entered the amygdala through the ansa peduncularis and ramified within the central and basolateral amygdaloid nuclei. Other fibers entered the diagonal band of Broca and formed a dense plexus of labeled fibers in the dorsal half of the intermediate portion of the lateral septal nucleus and the septohippocampal nucleus. These findings demonstrate that the basal forebrain and extended amygdala receive a dense projection from nonserotonergic DRN neurons.

The different serotonin-immunoreactive (5-HT-ir) neuronal populations that are found in adults were observed between the embryonic and metamorphic stages. The earliest serotonergic neurons were observed in the basal plate of the isthmus region of late embryos. In prolarvae, progressive appearance of new serotonergic cell groups was observed: firstly in the spinal cord, then in the pineal organ, tuberal region, zona limitans intrathalamica, rostral isthmus, and the caudal part of the rhombencephalon. In early larvae a new group of serotonergic cells was observed in the mammillary region, whereas in the pretectal region and the parapineal organ the first serotonergic cells were seen in the middle and late larval stages, respectively. The first serotonergic fibres appeared in early prolarvae, with fibres that ascend and descend from the isthmic cell group, and the number of immunoreactive fibres increased progressively until the adult stage.

The growth of Pc dendrites was early altered in lobules VIVIII of cerebellum vermis. In these lobules, at postnatal day (PD) 17, the cisplatin-induced increase of the serotoninergic receptor 5-HT2AR, a factor that inhibits Pc dendrite growth by acting post-synaptically, occurred in all cerebellar layers, suggesting also alteration of granule cell proliferation and migration. The decreased labelling of beta l adrenergic receptor (beta1AR) in the soma of some Pc at PD11 can be correlated with the altered expression of glutamate receptors and GAD65 (glutamic acid decarboxylase) of and on Pc we have previously described [Pisu, M.B., Guioli, S., Conforti, E., Bernocchi, G., 2003.

The labelling of 5-HT1AR in the ML areas lacking Pc dendrite branches could contribute to the recovery phase of the cerebellar cytoarchitecture in cisplatin-treated rats.

In organ of Corti organotypic cultures (OC), GM can induce a fast dose-dependent apoptosis of hair cells (HC), both external and internal. We found that, after coadministration of GM and Hie to organotypic cultures, the extract was able to significantly counteract this toxic effect on HC, at the concentration of 25 and 50 g/ml. Interestingly, at these concentrations the extract was present in the cell medium at a concentration 1.6- and 3.3-fold lower than GM, suggesting its otoprotective activity could not merely due to an aspecific inhibition of GM entry. To support this hypothesis, we evaluated the amount of GM present in organotypic cultures after the coadministration of 1.5 mg/ml GM and Hie, and found no significant reduction of GM uptake in the presence of 100 g/ml Hie. These data suggest the otoprotective action of Hie derives from specific inhibition of the apoptotic routine induced by GM treatment.",

Double labelling using antibodies against neurochemical markers was used to identify neuron subytpes bearing M1r. M1r immunoreactivity (IR) was present on neurons in the myenteric and submucosal ganglia. The two antibodies gave similar M1r-IR patterns and M1r-IR was abolished upon antibody preabsorption. M1r-IR was present on cholinergic and nNOS-IR nerve cell bodies in both guinea pig and human myenteric neurons. Presynaptic M1r-IR was present on NOS-IR and VAChT-IR nerve fibres in the circular muscle in the human colon. In the submucosal ganglia, M1r-IR was present on a population of neurons that contained cChAT-IR, but did not contain NPY-IR or calretinin-IR. M1r-IR was present on endothelial cells of blood vessels in the submucosal plexus. The localisation of M1r-IR in the guinea pig and human ENS shown in this study agrees with physiological studies. M1r-IR in cholinergic and nitrergic neurons and nerve fibres indicate that M1rs have a role in both cholinergic and nitrergic transmission. M1r-IR present in submucosal neurons suggests a role in mediating acetylcholine's effect on submucosal sensory and secretomotor/vasodilator neurons.

This specific challenge may lead to observable differences in the nuclear parcellation and morphology of these systems in the giraffe. Our personal observations in the giraffe reveal that, as with other Artiodactyls, the spinal cord extends to the caudal end of the sacral vertebrae. Within the giraffe medulla we found evidence for five putative catecholaminergic (neurons containing tyrosine hydroxylase) and five serotonergic nuclei.

The nuclear parcellation and appearance of both the putative catecholaminergic and serotonergic systems in the medulla of the giraffe studied are strikingly similar to that seen in previous studies of other Artiodactyls.

We examined the subcellular distribution of Tbr-1 in adult and postnatal rat brains using DAB stain and confocal imaging analysis. In contrast to the embryonic stage, Tbr-1 was distributed in P3 and adult rat brain in the nucleus as well as the cytoplasm of neurons in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Confocal analysis clearly showed dendritic distribution of Tbr-1 in pyramidal neurons. In the cerebellum of P15, P22, and adult rats, Tbr-1 was specifically expressed in Purkinje cells, where Tbr-1 was localised in the cytoplasm, including the dendritic tree. In addition, biochemical fractionation of adult cerebral cortex and hippocampus showed that cytoplasmic Tbr-1 is highly enriched in the lysed synaptosomal fraction, further indicating a synaptic distribution of cytoplasmic Tbr-1 in adult brain.

Moreover, there is evidence for an additional role of Reelin in sustaining synaptic plasticity in adult networks. Nitric oxide is an important gaseous messenger that can modulate neuronal plasticity both in developing and mature synaptic networks and has been shown to facilitate synaptic changes in the hippocampus, cerebellum and olfactory bulb. We studied the distribution and content of neuronal nitric oxide synthase in the olfactory bulbs of reeler and wildtype mice. Immunocytochemistry reveals that Reelin and neuronal nitric oxide synthase containing interneurons are two distinct, non overlapping cell populations of the olfactory bulb. We show by in situ hybridization that both nitrergic and Reelin expressing cells represent only a subset of olfactory bulb GABAergic neurons. Immunoblots show that neuronal nitric oxide synthase protein content is decreased by two thirds in reeler mice causing a detectable loss of immunolabelled cells throughout the olfactory bulb of this strain. However, neuronal nitric oxide synthase mRNA levels, essayed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR, are unaffected in the reeler olfactory bulb.

It is, however, not known whether the enzymatic sex difference reflects the differential activation of aromatase transcription or some other control mechanism. Although sex differences in aromatase activity are clearly documented in the HPOA of Japanese quail ( Coturnix japonica), only minimal or even no differences at all were observed in the number of aromatase-immunoreactive (ARO-ir) cells in the medial preoptic nucleus (POM) and in the medial part of the bed nucleus striae terminalis (BSTM). We investigated by in situ hybridization the distribution and possible sex differences in aromatase mRNA expression in the brain of sexually active adult quail. The distribution of aromatase mRNA matched very closely the results of previous immunocytochemical studies with the densest signal being observed in the POM, BSTM and in the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH). Additional weaker signals were detected in the rostral forebrain, arcopallium and mesencephalic regions. No sex difference in the optical density of the hybridization signal could be found in the POM and MBH but the area covered by mRNA was larger in males than in females, indicating a higher overall expression in males. In contrast, in the BSTM, similar areas were covered by the aromatase expression in both sexes but the density of the signal was higher in females than in males. The physiological control of aromatase is thus neuroanatomically specific and with regard to sex differences, these controls are at least partially different if one compares the level of transcription, translation and activity of the enzyme. These results also indirectly suggest that the sex difference in aromatase enzyme activity that is present in the quail HPOA largely results from differentiated controls of enzymatic activity rather than differences in enzyme concentration.",

In this study, the mRNA expression patterns of total leptin receptor, Ob-R, and the long signalling form of the receptor, Ob-Rb, were investigated in the brain of embryonic and newborn rats using in situ hybridisation and [ 125I]leptin binding. On embryonic day 18 (E18), Ob-R mRNA was detected in the choroid plexus and the ependymal layer of the third ventricle by in situ hybridisation. At E21, Ob-Rb mRNA was first observed in the arcuate and the ventral premammillary hypothalamic nuclei while at P3, receptor expression was also found in the dorsomedial nucleus. Other leptin target areas identified were the trigeminal ganglion, the thalamus and the hippocampus. Using quantitative receptor autoradiography specific [ 125I]leptin binding sites on the choroid plexus were found to increase with age in contrast to the ependymal layer of the third ventricle where levels decreased with age.

The highveld gerbil was chosen as it is relatively closely related to the laboratory rat, but the Gerbillinae and Murinae lineages diverged over 20 million years ago. Moreover, even though brain sizes are similar, the life history and phenotypes between these two species are substantially different. The gerbils used in the present study were caught from the wild, which is again another contrast to the laboratory rat. While these differences may lead to the prediction of significant differences in the nuclear complement of these systems, we found that all nuclei identified in both systems in the laboratory rat in several earlier studies had direct homologs in the brain of the highveld gerbil. Moreover, there were no additional nuclei in the brain of the highveld gerbil that are not found in the laboratory rat.

The loss of noradrenergic excitation is a major cause of sleep-related depression of activity in upper airway muscles innervated by the hypoglossal nerve.

RT-PCR analysis and Western blot detection indicate that the EcMBP is specific to hypothalamus, and expresses mainly in the tuberal hypothalamus in adult grouper.

To contribute data relevant to this debate, we used immunohistochemical techniques to reveal the architecture of the neuromodulatory systems of the Egyptian rousette ( Rousettus aegypticus), an echolocating megabat.

However, these findings may not be representative of other birds and these studies did not include a distribution of orexin-ir projections throughout the brain. The present study was carried out in a wild-caught passerine, the house finch, Carpodacus mexicanus, and includes a detailed description of orexin-ir neurons and their projections. Orexin A and B-ir neurons were located in a single population centered on the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus extending into the lateral hypothalamic area, consistent with other studies in birds. Orexin A and B-ir fibers were similarly visible across the brain, with the highest density within the preoptic area, hypothalamus and thalamus. Orexin-ir projections extended from the paraventricular nucleus rostrally to the preoptic area, laterally towards the medial striatum, nidopallium, and dorsally along the lateral ventricle towards the mesopallium. Caudally, the highest densities of orexin-ir fibers were found along the third ventricle. The periaqueductal grey, substantia nigra pars compacta and the locus coeruleus also showed a high density of orexin-ir fibers. This study showed a detailed fiber distribution previously unreported in birds and showed that orexin-ir neurons were located in similar areas regardless of phylogeny or domestication in birds. The apparently conserved neural distribution of orexins suggests that these peptides play similar roles among birds. The widespread distribution of the projections in brain areas serving various roles indicates the potential involvement of these peptides in multiple behavioral and physiological functions.",

In the present study, we used subtype-specific antibodies against D1 and D2 and confocal laser scanning microscopy to determine their perikaryal localization in striatum in general, and in direct and indirect pathway neuron perikarya defined by retrograde labeling in particular. We found that D1 in rat was detectable on 49.5% of NeuN-immunolabeled striatal perikarya, and D2 on 61.6% of NeuN-immunolabeled perikarya, implying that at least 1520% of D1+ neurons must possess D2 and vice versa. Secondly, we retrogradely labeled neuronal perikarya from the external globus pallidus (GPe), internal globus pallidus (GPi) or substantia nigra with rhodamine dextran amine 3 kDa (RDA3k). We found that 92% of perikarya labeled from nigra and 96% of perikarya labeled from GPi immunolabeled for D1, but only 23% of perikarya labeled from GPe immunolabeled for D1. Since direct pathway neurons (striato-nigral and striato-GPi) have a collateral projection to GPe, it is possible that many of the D1+ striatal perikarya retrogradely labeled from GPe were direct pathway neurons. About 96% of perikarya retrogradely labeled from GPe were immunolabeled for D2, while about 40% of those retrogradely labeled from GPi and 44% of those retrogradely labeled from nigra immunolabeled for D2. These findings suggest that: (1) while many striato-GPi/SN neurons possess D1 and D2, the majority mainly or exclusively possess D1 and (2) the vast majority of striato-GPe neurons mainly or exclusively possess D2.",

The main inhibitory neurotransmitter in vertebrates, GABA, has been implicated in both sensory and motor aspects of vocalizations in songbirds. To understand the role of GABAergic mechanisms in vocal communication, GABAergic elements must be characterized fully. Hence, we investigated GABA immunohistochemistry in the zebra finch brain, emphasizing auditory areas and song control nuclei. Several nuclei of the ascending auditory pathway showed a moderate to high density of GABAergic neurons including the cochlear nuclei, nucleus laminaris, superior olivary nucleus, mesencephalic nucleus lateralis pars dorsalis, and nucleus ovoidalis. Telencephalic auditory areas, including field L subfields L1, L2a and L3, as well as the caudomedial nidopallium (NCM) and mesopallium (CMM), contained GABAergic cells at particularly high densities. Considerable GABA labeling was also seen in the shelf area of caudodorsal nidopallium, and the cup area in the arcopallium, as well as in area X, the lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium, the robust nucleus of the arcopallium and nidopallial nucleus HVC. GABAergic cells were typically small, most likely local inhibitory interneurons, although large GABA-positive cells that were sparsely distributed were also identified. GABA-positive neurites and puncta were identified in most nuclei of the ascending auditory pathway and in song control nuclei.

In addition to the presence of cortical senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, AD is characterized at autopsy by extensive degeneration of brainstem locus coeruleus (LC) neurons that provide noradrenergic innervation to cortical neuropil, together with relative stability of dopaminergic neuron number in substantia nigra (SN) and ventral tegmental area (VTA). The present study used design-based stereological methods to assess catecholaminergic neuronal loss in brains of double transgenic female mice that co-express two human mutations associated with familial AD, amyloid precursor protein (APP swe) and presenilin-1 (PS1 E9). Mice were analyzed at two age groups, 36 months and 1623 months, when deposition of AD-type -amyloid (A) plaques occurs in cortical brain regions. Blocks of brain tissue containing the noradrenergic LC nucleus and two nuclei of dopaminergic neurons, the SN and VTA, were sectioned and sampled in a systematic-random manner and immunostained for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a specific marker for catecholaminergic neurons. Using the optical fractionator method we found a 24% reduction in the total number of TH-positive neurons in LC with no changes in SN-VTA of aged dtg APP/PS1 mice compared with non-transgenic controls. No significant differences were observed in numbers of TH-positive neurons in LC or SN-VTA in brains of young female dtg APP/PS1 mice compared to their age-matched controls. The findings of selective neurodegeneration of LC neurons in the brains of aged female dtg APP/PS1 mice mimic the neuropathology in the brains of AD patients at autopsy.

We therefore used immunolabeling to assess the frequency and abundance of GluR1 and GluR2, the most common AMPA subunits in striatum, in the main striatal neuron types. All neurons projecting to the external pallidum (GPe), internal pallidum (GPi) or substantia nigra, as identified by retrograde labeling, possessed perikaryal GluR2, while GluR1 was more common in striato-GPe than striato-GPi perikarya. The frequency and intensity of immunostaining indicated the rank order of their perikaryal GluR1:GluR2 ratio to be striato-GPe > striatonigral > striato-GPi. Ultrastructural studies suggested a differential localization of GluR1 and GluR2 to striatal projection neuron dendritic spines as well, with GluR1 seemingly more common in striato-GPe spines and GluR2 more common in striato-GPi and/or striatonigral spines. Comparisons among projection neurons and interneurons revealed GluR1 to be most common and abundant in parvalbuminergic interneurons, and GluR2 most common and abundant in projection neurons, with the rank order for the GluR1:GluR2 ratio being parvalbuminergic interneurons > calretinergic interneurons > cholinergic interneurons > projection neurons > somatostatinergic interneurons. Striosomal projection neurons had a higher GluR1:GluR2 ratio than did matrix projection neurons. The abundance of both GluR1 and GluR2 in striatal parvalbuminergic interneurons and projection neurons is consistent with their prominent cortical input and susceptibility to excitotoxic insult, while differences in GluR1:GluR2 ratio among projection neurons are likely to yield differences in Ca 2+ permeability, desensitization, and single channel current, which may contribute to differences among them in plasticity, synaptic integration, and excitotoxic vulnerability. The apparent association of the GluR1 subunit with synaptic plasticity, in particular, suggests striato-GPe neuron spines as a particular site of corticostriatal synaptic plasticity, presumably associated with motor learning.",

DCX expression is generally maximal during embryonic and early post-natal life but decreases markedly and almost disappears in older animals in parallel with the major decrease or cessation of neurogenesis. In several seasonally breeding songbird species such as canaries, the volume of several song control nuclei in the brain varies seasonally such that the largest nuclei are observed in the late spring and early summer. This variation is based on changes in cell size, dendritic branching, and, in nucleus HVC, on the incorporation of neurons newly born in adulthood. Because songbirds maintain an active neurogenesis and neuronal incorporation in their telencephalon throughout their lives, we investigated here the distribution of DCX-immunoreactive (ir) structures in the brain of adult male canaries. Densely stained DCX-ir cells were found exclusively in parts of the telencephalon that are known to incorporate new neurons in adulthood, in particular the nidopallium. Within this brain region, the boundaries of the song control nucleus HVC could be clearly distinguished from surrounding structures by a higher density of DCX-ir structures. In most telencephalic areas, about two thirds of these cells displayed a uni- or bipolar fusiform morphology suggesting they were migrating neurons. The rest of the DCX-ir cells in the telencephalon were larger and had a round multipolar morphology. No such staining was found in the rest of the brain. The broad expression of DCX specifically in adult brain structures that exhibit the characteristic of active incorporation of new neurons suggests that DCX plays a key role in the migration of new neurons in the brain of adult songbirds as it presumably does during ontogeny.",

Although this system is known to be compromised both prior to and during retinal degeneration, the spatial dynamics of dopamine turnover within the degenerate retina are at present unknown. Here, using immunohistochemistry for dopamine in combination with quantitative optical density measurements, we reveal a global decline in retinal dopamine levels in the light adapted RCS dystrophic rat, which is restricted to plexiform layers in the dark. Pharmacological blockade of dopamine production with the drug -methyl- p-tyrosine (AMPT) allows the direct visualisation of dopamine depletion in normal and degenerate retina in response to constant illumination. In normal retinae this effect is spatially discrete, being undetectable in perikarya and specific to amacrine cell fibres in sublamina 1 of the inner plexiform layer. A similar response was observed in the retinae of dystrophic rats but with a reduction in amplitude of approximately 50%. It is suggested that the pattern of dopamine depletion observed in rat retina may reflect an AMPT-resistant pool of perikaryal dopamine and/or a reduction in extrasynaptic release of this neurotransmitter in response to illumination in vivo. We conclude that the visualisation of dopamine depletion reported here represents a release of this neurotransmitter in the response to light. Turnover of dopamine in the dystrophic retina is discussed in the context of surviving photoreceptors, including the intrinsically photosensitive melanopsin ganglion cells of the inner retina.",

As cGMP levels are controlled by the activity of soluble guanylyl cyclase (synthesis) and the phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity (breakdown), we studied the influence of PDE activity on NO-stimulated cGMP levels in the rat cervical spinal cord. cGMP-immunoreactivity (cGMP-IR) was localized in sections prepared from slices incubated in vitro. A number of reported PDE isoform-selective PDE inhibitors was studied in combination with diethylamineNONOate (DEANO) as a NO-donor including isobutyl-methylxanthine (IBMX) as a non-selective PDE inhibitor. We studied 8-methoxy-IBMX as a selective PDE1 inhibitor, erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine (EHNA) and BAY 60-7550 as selective PDE2 inhibitors, sildenafil as a selective PDE5 inhibitor, dipyridamole as a mixed type PDE5 and PDE10 inhibitor, rolipram as a PDE4 inhibitor, and SCH 81566 as a selective PDE9 inhibitor. cGMP-IR structures (nerve fibers, axons, and terminals) were characterized using the following neurochemical markers: vesicular transporter molecules for acetylcholine, GABA, and glutamate (type 1 and type 2), parvalbumin, glutamate transporter molecule EAAT3, synaptophysin, substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide, and isolectin B4. Most intense cGMP-IR was observed in the dorsal lamina. Ventral motor neurons were devoid of cGMP-IR. cGMP-IR was observed in GABAergic, and glutamatergic terminals in all gray matter laminae. cGMP-IR was abundantly colocalized with anti-vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (vGLUT2), however not with the anti-vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vGLUT1), suggesting a functional difference between structures expressing vGLUT1 or vGLUT2. cGMP-IR did not colocalize with substance P- or calcitonin-gene related peptide-IR structures, however did partially colocalize with isolectin B4 in the dorsal horn. cGMP-IR in cholinergic structures was observed in dorsal root fibers entering the spinal cord, occasionally in laminae 13, in laminae 8 and 9 in isolated boutons and in the C-type terminals, and in small cells and varicosities in lamina 10. This latter observation suggests that the proprioceptive interneurons arising in lamina 10 are also NO-responsive. No region-specific nor a constant co-expression of cGMP-IR with various neuronal markers was observed after incubation of the slices with one of the selected PDE inhibitors. Expression of the mRNA of PDE2, 5, and 9 was observed in all lamina. The ventral motor neurons and the ependymal cells lining the central canal expressed all three PDE isoforms. Incubation of the slices in the presence of IBMX, DEANO in combination with BAY 41-2272, a NO-independent activator of soluble guanylyl cyclase, provided evidence for endogenous NO synthesis in the slice preparations and enhanced cGMP-IR in all lamina. Under these conditions cGMP-IR colocalized with substance P in a subpopulation of substance P-IR fibers. It is concluded that NO functions as a retrograde neurotransmitter in the spinal cord but that also postsynaptic structures are NO-responsive by producing cGMP. cGMP-IR in a subpopulation of isolectin B4 positive fibers and boutons is indicative for a role of NO-cGMP signaling in nociceptive processing. cGMP levels in the spinal cord are controlled by the concerted action of a number of PDE isoforms, which can be present in the same cell.",

The effects of microinjections of bradykinin into the principal sensory trigeminal nucleus (PSTN) before and after neurochemical lesions of the locus coeruleus noradrenergic neurons were studied. Neuroanatomical experiments showed evidence for reciprocal neuronal pathways connecting the locus coeruleus (LC) to trigeminal sensory nuclei and linking monoaminergic nuclei of the pain inhibitory system to spinal trigeminal nucleus (STN). Fast blue (FB) injections in the locus coeruleus/subcoeruleus region retrogradely labeled neurons in the contralateral PSTN and LC. Microinjections of FB into the STN showed neurons labeled in both ipsilateral and contralateral LC, as well as in the ipsilateral Barrington's nucleus and subcoeruleus area. Retrograde tract-tracing with FB also showed that the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus sends neural pathways towards the ipsilateral PSTN, with outputs from cranial and caudal aspects of the brainstem. In addition, neurons from the lateral and dorsolateral columns of periaqueductal gray matter also send outputs to the ipsilateral PSTN. Microinjections of FB in the interpolar and caudal divisions of the STN labeled neurons in the caudal subdivision of STN. Microinjections in the STN interpolar and caudal divisions also retrogradely labeled serotonin- and noradrenaline-containing nucleus of the brainstem pain inhibitory system. Finally, the gigantocellularis complex (nucleus reticularis gigantocellularis/paragigantocellularis), nucleus raphe magnus and nucleus raphe pallidus also projected to the caudal divisions of the STN.

Labeling of cell bodies matched well the previously defined subnuclei: The dorsolateral septal nucleus contains enkephalin-immunoreactive (-ir) and weakly stained GABA-ir neurons; calretinin-ir and weakly labeled GABA-ir neurons are found in the ventrolateral septal nucleus. The medial septal nucleus is characterized by the presence of numerous ChAT-ir and some tyrosine hydroxylase-ir neurons, while the dorsal septal nucleus is outlined by its NPY-ir neurons. Many ChAT-ir and some aspartate-ir and somatostatin-ir neurons are found in the diagonal band of Broca, and the central septal nucleus contains some GABA-ir and ChAT-ir neurons. In contrast, labeled fibers form a pattern which does not match the boundaries of septal subnuclei. Comparing the anuran septal complex with that of other vertebrates reveals that the complexity of the lateral septum has increased during the evolution from anamniote to amniote vertebrates. In spite of this fact, many similarities in chemoarchitecture between anurans and other vertebrates are evident. Some basal septal functions such as involvement in learning and memory formation or inhibition of sexual behavior appear to have persisted during vertebrate evolution.",

Merino female sheep ( n = 16) were randomly divided into four groups, two fed with standard feeds and two fasted for 72 h. One standard and one fasted groups were infused with Ringer saline (controls), remaining standard and fasted groups with leptin (25 g/120 l/h), for 4 h during three consecutive days, and then slaughtered. Ir NPY and ir GnRH were localized by immunohistochemistry using specific polyclonal antibodies. Detection of both hormones was followed by the image analysis and expressed as the percent area stained and integral density of immunostaining. In the hypothalami from all groups the ir NPY perikarya and varicose nerve fibers were localized in three distinct sub-areas, in the arcuate (ARC), paraventricular and periventricular nuclei. In fasted sheep the percent area and integral density for immunoreactivity of NPY increased significantly ( P < 0.001) in three sub-areas compared to the standard-fed animals. Leptin infusion lowered the both parameters ( P < 0.001) but solely in the ARC NPY population of fasted sheep. The percent area and integral density of immunostaining for ir GnRH in fasted sheep revealed the augmentation ( P < 0.001) compared to standard-fed sheep. Leptin infusions diminished ( P < 0.001) both parameters in fasted, without effects in standard-fed lambs. In conclusion, the enhanced by fasting immunoreactivity of the ARC NPY perikarya and varicose nerve fibers and restrained immunoreaction of GnRH terminals in the median eminence were reversed by exogenous leptin. It is suggested that leptin can affect GnRH release via ARC NPY neurons in conditions of deficit of nutrients in prepubertal, female lambs.",

The corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) and gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in the median eminence and the adenohypophyseal adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH), gonadotrophins (LH and FSH) and mRNAs for their -subunits were investigated using the immunohistochemistry or hybridohistochemistry.

In conclusion, maternal deprivation affected the accumulation of CRH and ACTH. The different and more striking alterations in FSH synthesis and storage in comparison with those concerning LH were observed in maternally deprived lambs.

VGLUT2 immunoreactivity in the dorsal claustrum starts to be observed at E16.5, with a dramatic increase towards P0. At this age, abundant VGLUT2-immunoreactive axons and puncta are observed in all pallial regions, including the claustral complex. From the first postnatal week, VGLUT2 immunoreactivity declines in several telencephalic areas, including the pallium, but abundant VGLUT2-immunoreactive fine axons and puncta remain in the claustrum. Beginning at E18.5, VGLUT2 immunoreactivity within the claustrum shows a characteristic arrangement: a central part of the region is practically devoid of VGLUT2 immunoreactivity, and it is surrounded by plenty of immunoreactive axon terminals forming a shell around it. This core/shell arrangement of the VGLUT2 immunoreactivity resembles the complementary expression of parvalbumin and calretinin described in the mouse claustrum [Real, M.A., Davila, J.C., Guirado, S., 2003. Expression of calcium-binding proteins in the mouse claustrum. J. Chem. Neuroanat. 25, 151160]. We observed immunoreactive neuronal cell bodies as well in the dorsal claustrum, but only at P0. Electron microscopic analysis reveals that VGLUT2 immunoreactivity in the developing and adult dorsal claustrum consists predominantly of presynaptic boutons making asymmetric synaptic contacts. These VGLUT2-immunoreactive boutons are observed as early as E16.5 and may be related to thalamo-claustral incoming fibers.",

Stress alters serotonin (5-HT) release in a regionally specific manner. For example, swim stress increases extracellular levels of 5-HT in the striatum and decreases levels in the lateral septum. This finding suggests that the 5-HT efferents to the striatum and lateral septum arise from distinct populations of DRN neurons that are differentially affected by swim stress. To further examine this, retrograde axonal transport of fluorescent RetroBeadsTM was used to identify the distribution of DRN neurons projecting to the lateral septum and striatum in the rat brain. Retrograde labeling from the lateral septum was observed primarily within the more caudal portions of the DRN, while labeling from the striatum was observed in neurons located in the more rostral regions of the DRN. Few cell bodies were observed that were labeled from both the striatum and lateral septum suggesting that DRN neurons do not send collateralized projections to the septal region and striatum. Many septal- and striatal-projecting neurons in the DRN exhibited 5-HT, and collateralized projections, when observed, were immunoreactive for 5-HT. Taken together with previous microdialysis studies, these results support the existence of distinct DRN5-HT-forebrain projections that are differentially regulated by stress.",

Glycogen phosphorylase reactivity highlighted entorhinal cortex in contrast to less densely stained perirhinal cortex or neocortex. The presubiculum, but not parasubiculum, was strongly reactive for glycogen phosphorylase. Within medial and lateral entorhinal cortex, modularity of active glycogen phosphorylase reactivity was apparent. In inner Layer I there were small (50 m) intense patches of active glycogen phosphorylase. In Layer III there were both small and larger (200 m), patches of active glycogen phosphorylase. Lamina dessicans was reactive. Layers V and VI were relatively unreactive. Exposure to a holeboard intensified the small patches of active glycogen phosphorylase in inner Layer I, while attenuating active glycogen phosphorylase reactivity in Layer III. Total glycogen phosphorylase was unaffected by exposure to the novel environment and exhibited a pattern of continuous dense reactivity suggesting enzyme reserves, particularly in superficial layers of entorhinal cortex.

An examination has been made in 15 infantile (12-, 15-week-old) and juvenile (22-, 30-week-old) ovary-intact sheep. Histomorphological and functional changes in the adenohypophyseal population of gonadotrophs were assayed with hybridohistochemistry, immunohistochemistry and radioimmunoassay. The percentage of the adenohypophyseal area (PAA) occupied by gonadotrophs containing LH-mRNA or FSH-mRNA was highest ( P < 0.05) in the 15-week-old sheep compared with the other stages. The gradual increase in the PAA occupied by immunoreactive (ir)-LH-cells from the 12th to 30th week of age was observed ( P < 0.05) and has been interpreted as the increase in the storage of LH. This histomorphological change was accompanied by the gradual increase in the LH pulse frequency from the 15th to 30th week of age ( P < 0.05). The PAA occupied by ir-FSH-cells was extremely high in the infantile sheep, and subsequently, low in the juvenile sheep ( P < 0.05). Altogether, similar patterns of pretranslational synthesis of the LH- and FSH-subunit but clearly different storage patterns of gonadotrophins were observed. The postnatal development of gonadotrophins seems to be determined by the progressive increase in the storage of LH until peripuberty and by the acute decrease in the storage of FSH during the infantile/juvenile shift. These findings imply the different intrahypophyseal regulation of LH and FSH posttranscriptional processing during the period of transition between infancy and peripuberty in female sheep.",

Results indicate that ozone exposure causes a significant decrease in motor activity. Ozone produced lipid peroxidation, morphological alterations, loss of fibers and cell death of the dopaminergic neurons.

We have previously demonstrated that in the human Huntington's disease brain there are increased numbers of progenitor cells proportional to the severity of the gene defect responsible for the disease and proportional to the severity of the pathology of the disease. One of the criticisms of a potential endogenous progenitor cell replacement therapy has been that the endogenous progenitor cells also contain the Huntington's disease gene and would therefore be just as susceptible to degeneration as those in the degenerate brain region. In the present study we have demonstrated the presence of cannabinoid CB1 receptors, which are preferentially lost in Huntington's disease, colocalised with the proliferative marker PCNA in the adult normal and Huntington's disease subependymal layer. This population of CB1 positive cells only colabels with PCNA and not with neuronal, glial, microglial or oligodendrocyte markers. These results indicate that the subependymal layer in Huntington's disease contains a subpopulation of proliferating cells that are also CB1 receptor positive and are thus not immediately susceptible to the neurodegenerative process that denudes the striatum of CB1 receptors.

As in other species, small, intensely nNOS-immunoreactive cells were seen within the olfactory tubercle, caudate nucleus, putamen, nucleus accumbens and amygdala. In addition, a population of mixed large and small nNOS positive cells was found in the medial septum, diagonal band and nucleus basalis overlapping the distribution of the magnocellular cholinergic system of the basal forebrain. Our results show that the distribution of NOS containing neurons in these nuclei in the dog is more extensive and uniform than that reported in rodents and primates. When double labeling of nNOS and NADPH-d was performed in the same tissue section most neurons were double labeled. However, a considerable number of large perikarya in the diagonal band and nucleus basalis appeared to be single labeled for nNOS. Thought a certain degree of interference between the two procedures could not be completely excluded, these findings suggest that NADPH-d histochemistry, which is frequently used to show the presence of NOS, underestimates the potential of basal forebrains neurons to produce nitric oxide. In addition, a few neurons mainly localized among the fibers of the internal capsule, appeared to be labeled only for NADPH-d. These neurons could be expressing a different isoform of NOS, not recognized by our anti-nNOS antibody, as has been reported in healthy humans and AD patients.",

The current study investigated whether a loss or shrinkage of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic interneurons contribute to that decline. Coronal sections from middle-aged (1517 months) and old (2529 months) Fischer 344 X Brown Norway male rats were immunoreacted with antibodies to the GABA synthesizing enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD); the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin (PV), or the neuronal marker NeuN. The number of GAD-immunoreactive (IR), PV-IR, and NeuN-IR cells were determined stereologically using the optical disector technique and the cross-sectional areas of GAD-IR cells were measured in layers II/III, IV, V and VI of sensorimotor cortex. Neither the number of GAD-IR or NeuN-IR cells, nor the size of GAD-IR cells, declined significantly between middle and old age. A modest decline in the PV-IR subset of inhibitory interneurons was observed, predominantly due to changes in layers V and VI. Stereological analysis of layer II/III GAD-IR boutons revealed a stability of immunocytochemically identified inhibitory terminals. Taken together, these results indicate a general maintenance of overall GABAergic neurons in sensorimotor cortex between middle and old age and the loss of ultrastructurally identified inhibitory synapses may be due to the decline of a subset of GABAergic terminals.",

This information is complemented with data on spinal cord-projecting systems that were characterized using retrograde tracing, spinal hemisections, and double labeling techniques.

For example, catecholaminergic neurons in the (ventro)lateral pons (A5 and A7 cell groups) in the mouse project to the spinal cord mainly via contralateral, and not ipsilateral, pathways.

In the neocortex of Thylamys, these methods revealed PNs on pyramidal cells. In contrast, parvalbumin-immunoreactive interneurons in the neocortex and hippocampal formation (displaying robust, WFA-labeled PNs in placental mammals) were ensheathed only with a delicate rim of hyaluronan and proteoglycans not detectable with WFA. The absence of WFA staining was characteristic also of some subcortical regions which contained PNs intensely labeled for chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan and hyaluronan. However, corresponding to placental mammals, numerous subcortical nuclei showed clearly WFA-stained PNs. Similar as in placental mammals, cholinergic basal forebrain neurons and tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive neurons of the substantia nigra and locus coeruleus were devoid of PNs.

The effects of the increase or decrease of activity of nigrocollicular inputs on defensive responses elicited by either electrical or chemical stimulation of the IC were also determined. Electrolytic or chemical lesions of the substantia nigra, pars reticulata (SNpr), decreased the freezing and escape behaviors thresholds elicited by electrical stimulation of the IC, and increased the behavioral responses evoked by the GABA A blockade in the same sites of the mesencephalic tectum (MT) electrically stimulated. These findings were corroborated by similar effects caused by microinjections of the GABA A-receptor agonist muscimol in the SNpr, followed by electrical and chemical stimulations of the IC. The GABA A blockade in the SNpr caused a significant increase in the defensive behavior thresholds elicited by electrical stimulation of the IC and a decrease in the mean incidence of panic-like responses induced by microinjections of bicuculline in the mesencephalic tectum (inferior colliculus). These findings suggest that the substantia nigra receives GABAergic inputs that modulate local and also inhibitory GABAergic outputs toward the IC. In fact, neurotracing experiments with fast blue and iontophoretic microinjections of biotinylated dextran amine either into the inferior colliculus or in the reticular division of the substantia nigra demonstrated a neural link between these structures, as well as between the neostriatum and SNpr.",

Unilateral intrastriatal infusion of MPP + (100 and 200 nmol in 4 l saline) caused a dose-dependent depletion of striatal DA (69 and 92%, respectively), as measured employing HPLC electrochemistry.

The main mechanism of regulation of the HPA axis activity is via negative feedback at all levels of the HPA axis itself as well as at the extra-hypothalamic level, a central part of which is the hippocampus. During neonatal development, the HPA axis of rats undergoes a period of hyporesponsiveness (SHRP)when most stress stimuli fail to induce stress-response. Here, we describe the pattern of GR proteins expression in the hippocampal area of the rat brain during postnatal development and in adulthood. We demonstrated that the GR protein, of which its expression level is gradually enhanced in the hippocampus during postnatal life, exists in three different molecular sized forms. A larger molecular form was expressed at rather high levels at all studied time periods. A second smaller variant of GR was transiently expressed during the first one and a half weeks that corresponds with SHRP and then appeared again only in the adulthood. By the end of SHRP on PD 13, third smallest protein form of GR started to be detected in the hippocampal area. Thus, it remains to be disclosed in the nearest future, how the hippocampal GR isoforms may be involved in regulation of the neonatal HPA axis hyporesponsiveness as well as in functions of this system during the ensuing period of the brain maturation.",

The DRGs and spinal cord were analysed before and after a unilateral, complete transection (axotomy) of the sciatic nerve and after dorsal rhizotomy. Both galanin protein and transcript were studied by, respectively, immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Increased galanin expression was observed in several small, medium-sized and large DRG neuron profiles (NPs) in the naive transgenic mouse, frequently in neurons lacking calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and isolectin B4-binding. This lack of coexistence was particularly evident in the medium-sized/large NPs. In the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, no differences were detected between GalOE-DBH and WT mice, both displaying a strong galanin-positive neuropil in the superficial laminae of the dorsal horn, but the transgenic mice showed a more abundant galanin-positive innervation of the ventral horn. A 12-day dorsal rhizotomy, surprisingly, failed to alter the galanin staining patterns in the dorsal (and ventral) dorsal horn. Unilateral axotomy induced upregulation of galanin in DRG NPs of all sizes in both types of mouse. In the hindpaw skin, a profuse galanin-positive fiber plexus was observed in sweat glands and around blood vessels of the transgenic mice, being much more restricted in WT mice. Finally, GalOE mice exhibited a strong galanin-like immunoreactivity in most SCG NPs. The overexpression of the peptide in DRGs and SCGs was paralleled by increased mRNA levels. The present results show that overexpression of galanin under the control of the DBH promoter does not only occur, as expected in these mice, in noradrenline/adrenaline neurons but also in DRG neurons, particularly in large and medium-sized NPs.

In the neurons of the ipsilateral ventral horn, RGMa was also induced at 10 days after surgery, whereas no RGMa signal could be observed in naive conditions or at 24 h after surgery.

This locus is the mesopontine tegmental anesthesia area (MPTA). Although anesthetic agents directly influence spinal cord nociceptive processing, antinociception during intracerebral microinjection indicates that they can also act supraspinally. Using neuroanatomical tracing methods we show that the MPTA has multiple descending projections to brainstem and spinal areas associated with pain modulation. Most prominent is a massive projection to the rostromedial medulla, a nodal region for descending pain modulation. Together with the periaqueductal gray (PAG), the MPTA is the major mesopontine input to this region. Less dense projections target the PAG, the locus coeruleus and pericoerulear areas, and dorsal and ventral reticular nuclei of the caudal medulla. The MPTA also has modest direct projections to the trigeminal nuclear complex and to superficial layers of the dorsal horn. Double anterograde and retrograde labeling at the light and electron microscopic levels shows that MPTA neurons with descending projections synapse directly on spinally projecting cells of rostromedial medulla.

NMDA receptors (NMDAR), which play key roles in excitotoxicity and synaptic plasticity, have not been characterized in a hibernating species. Tolerance to excitotoxicity and cognitive enhancement in Arctic ground squirrels (AGS, Spermophilus parryii) suggests that NMDAR expression may decrease in hibernation and increase upon arousal. NMDAR consist of at least one NMDAR1 (NR1) subunit, which is required for receptor function. Localization of NR1 reflects localization of the majority, if not all, NMDAR complexes. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to characterize the distribution of NR1 subunits in AGS central nervous system using immunohistochemistry. In addition, we compare NR1 expression in hippocampus of hibernating AGS (hAGS) and inter-bout euthermic AGS (ibeAGS) and assess changes in cell somata size using NR1 stained sections in three hippocampal sub-regions (CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus). For the first time, we report that immunoreactivity of anti-NR1 is widely distributed throughout the central nervous system in AGS and is similar to other species. No differences exist in the expression and distribution of NR1 in hAGS and ibeAGS. However, we report a significant decrease in size of hippocampal CA1 and dentate gyrus NR1-expressing neuronal somata during hibernation torpor.",

In prefrontal and temporal cortices, GAT-3 immunoreactivity (ir) was present throughout the depth of the cortex, both in puncta and in neurons. GAT-3-positive puncta were dispersed in the neuropil or closely related to cell bodies; neuronal staining was in perikarya, especially of pyramidal cells, and proximal dendrites.

The olfactostriatum is densely immunoreactive for serotonin and neuropeptide Y and shows moderate-to-weak immunoreactivity for tyrosine hydroxylase. In addition to afferents from the nucleus sphericus, the olfactostriatum receives inputs from the dorsal and lateral cortices, nucleus of the accessory olfactory tract, external and dorsolateral amygdalae, dorsomedial thalamic nucleus, ventral tegmental area and raphe nuclei. Double labeling experiments demonstrated that the distribution of serotonin and neuropeptide Y in this area almost completely overlaps the terminal field of projections from the nucleus sphericus. Also, serotonergic and dopaminergic innervation of the olfactostriatum likely arise, respectively, from the raphe nuclei and the ventral tegmental area, whereas local circuit neurons originate the neuropeptide Y immunoreactivity.

In the present study, we examined the immunoreactivity (IR) of delta-, kappa- and mu-opioid receptors (DOR, KOR and MOR, respectively), in 164 electrophysiologically subclassified DRG neurons. The expression of opioid receptors in the DRG cell types was diverse. Type 1 (2530 m cell diameter) and type 9 (3545 m) expressed MOR-IR, but were negative for DOR-IR and KOR-IR. Type 2 (2530 m) co-expressed DOR-IR and MOR-IR, but did not express KOR-IR. Type 3 (1520 m), the non-nociceptive cell type, was not immunoreactive. Type 4 (3545 m), type 6 (3545 m), and type 7 (1520 m) expressed all three opioid receptors. Type 5 (3545 m) and type 8 (3545 m), co-expressed KOR-IR and MOR-IR, but did not express DOR-IR. The co-expression of opioid receptors in some of the cell types suggests that these sensory afferents might contain heteromeric opioid receptors. Additionally, the diverse expression patterns of opioid receptors between cell types and the consistency of these patterns maintained within each cell type provides further evidence of distinct functional properties of DRG nociceptors.",

Although synaptobrevin/VAMP 1 is less abundant, it is the main isoform in particular brain areas (e.g. zona incerta at the subthalamus or nerve terminals surrounding thalamic neurons).

Light and electron microscopic immunocytochemical studies revealed that these parvalbumin-immunoreactive complexes are brought about by parvalbumin-immunoreactive calyciform terminals which establish synapses with large, parvalbumin-immunonegative dendritic profiles. Transection of thalamo-reticular connections did not cause any alteration of calyciform terminals in the reticular thalamic nucleus. Nuclear counterstaining revealed that parvalbumin-immunoreactive calyciform terminals originated from local parvalbumin-immunoreactive interneuronal perikarya, which, depending of the length of the neck protruding from the perikaryon, establish somato-dendritic, axo-dendritic or dendro-dendritic synapses. Light and electron microscopic immunocytochemical investigations prove that the parvalbumin-immunoreactive calyciform complexes contain also GABA, that are likely to be inhibitory. In accordance with literature data, our results suggest that parvalbumin-immunoreactive GABAergic calyciform terminals in the reticular thalamic nucleus may be instrumental in intrinsic cell-to-cell communications and, as such, may be involved in synchronisation of thalamo-cortical oscillations, in the production of sleep spindles and in attentional processes.",

Central microinjections of naloxonazine, a selective  1-opiod receptor antagonist, in the mesencephalic tectum (MT) caused a significant increase in the escape thresholds elicited by local electrical stimulation. Furthermore, either naltrexone or naloxonazine microinjected in the substantia nigra, pars reticulata (SNpr), caused a significant increase in the defensive thresholds elicited by electrical stimulation of the continuum comprised by dorsolateral aspects of the periaqueductal gray matter (dlPAG) and deep layers of the superior colliculus (dlSC), as compared with controls. These findings suggest an opioid modulation of GABAergic inhibitory inputs controlling the defensive behavior elicited by MT stimulation, in cranial aspects. In fact, iontophoretic microinjections of the neurotracer biodextran into the SNpr, a mesencephalic structure rich in GABA-containing neurons, show outputs to neural substrate of the dlSC/dlPAG involved with the generation and organization of fear- and panic-like reactions. Neurochemical lesion of the nigrotectal pathways increased the sensitivity of the MT to electrical (at alertness, freezing and escape thresholds) and chemical (blockade of GABA A receptors) stimulation, suggesting a tonic modulatory effect of the nigrotectal GABAergic outputs on the neural networks of the MT involved with the organization of the defensive behavior and panic-like reactions. Labeled neurons of the midbrain tectum send inputs with varicosities to ipsi and contralateral dlSC/dlPAG and ipsilateral substantia nigra, pars reticulata and compacta, in which the anterograde and retrograde tracing from a single injection indicates that the substantia nigra has reciprocal connections with the dlSC/dlPAG featuring close axo-somatic and axo-dendritic appositions in both locations. In addition, ultrastructural approaches show inhibitory axo-axonic synapses in MT and inhibitory axo-somatic/axo-axonic synapses in the SNpr. These findings, in addition to the psychopharmacological evidence for the interaction between opioid and GABAergic mechanisms in the cranial aspects of the MT as well as in the mesencephalic tegmentum, offer a neuroanatomical basis of a pre-synaptic opioid inhibition of GABAergic nigrotectal neurons modulating fear in defensive behavior-related structures of the cranial mesencephalon, in a short link, and through a major neural circuit, also in GABA-containing perikarya and axons of nigrotectal neurons.",

The aim of our study was to investigate these changes occurring after chronic formaldehyde toxicity in frontal cortex and hippocampal tissues, and protective effect of Vitamin E (vit E) against oxidative damage. Eighteen rats were divided into three groups: (1) control, (2) treated with FA (FAt), and (3) treated with FA and vit E (FAt + vit E) groups. After the treatment, the animals were sacrificed and frontal cortex and hippocampal tissues were removed for biochemical and histopathological investigation. FA significantly increased tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl (PC) levels and also decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) enzyme activities in frontal cortex and hippocampal tissue compared to control. Vit E treatment decreased MDA and PC levels and prevented inhibition of SOD and CAT enzymes in the tissues. In the FAt group, the neurons of both tissues became extensively dark and degenerated with picnotic nuclei. The morphology of neurons in FAt + vit E group was protected well, but not as neurons of the control group. The number of neurons in frontal cortex and hippocampal tissue of FAt group was significantly less than both control and FAt + vit E groups. It was concluded that vit E treatment might be beneficial in preventing FA-induced oxidative frontal cortex and hippocampal tissue damage, therefore, shows potential for clinical use.",

In the substantia nigra pars compacta there were in turn two populations of acetylcholinesterase containing neurons: those that were tyrosine hydroxylase reactive and those that were not. Double label studies, that included an antibody immunoreactive against a common immunogen on 1 of muscle and 3 and 5 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits, revealed that nearly all nicotinic receptor positive cells were also tyrosine hydroxylase neurons. However, a minority non-tyrosine hydroxylase population was 3- and/or 5-nAChR positive and these were always AChE-immunoreactive.

In this study, the selective innervation of specific glomeruli by serotonergic, noradrenergic and cholinergic centrifugal axons was analyzed. Thus, the morphology, distribution and density of positive axons were studied in the glomerular layer of the main olfactory bulb of the rat, using serotonin-, serotonin transporter- and dopamine- -hydroxylase-immunohistochemistry and acetylcholinesterase histochemistry in serial sections. Serotonin-, serotonin transporter-immunostaining and acetylcholinesterase-staining revealed a higher heterogeneity in the glomerular layer of the main olfactory bulb than previously reported. In this sense, four types of glomeruli could be identified according to their serotonergic innervation. The main distinctive feature of these four types of glomeruli was their serotonergic fibre density, although they also differed in their size, morphology and relative position throughout the rostro-caudal main olfactory bulb. In this sense, some specific regions of the glomerular layer were occupied by glomeruli with a particular morphology and a characteristic serotonergic innervation pattern that was consistent from animal to animal. Regarding the cholinergic system, we offer a new subclassification of glomeruli based on the distribution of cholinergic fibres in the glomerular structure. Finally, the serotonergic and cholinergic innervation patterns were compared in the glomerular layer. Sexual differences concerning the density of serotonergic fibres were observed in the atypical glomeruli (characterized by their strong cholinergic innervation). The present report provides new data on the heterogeneity of the centrifugal innervation of the glomerular layer that constitutes the morphological substrate supporting the existence of differential modulatory levels among the entire glomerular population.",

However, it remained to be determined whether or not these two enzymes coexist in the same neurons which contain the PR. To test this hypothesis and quantify these colocalization relationships in the hypothalamus, we used a triple-labeling immunofluorescence procedure. Only PR/AADC-immunoreactive cells were seen in the preoptic area but no PR/TH cells and, therefore, no triple immunoreactive cells were found. An occasional colocalization between PR and the two enzymes was observed throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the arcuate nucleus with the greatest concentration of triple-labeled cells in the medial subdivision. In this region, quantitative estimation of cellular immunoreactivity showed that the triple immunoreactive cells represented about 29% of PR/TH cells, 9% of PR/AADC cells and 22% of TH/AADC cells in spite of a very low percentage in relation to total populations of neurons expressing only PR, TH or AADC.

Then, reelin-ir in normal mice was compared to that of transgenic mice (APP/PS1) carrying mutated human APP and PS1 genes, which are linked to the familial form of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The APP/PS1 mice were additionally burdened with a second risk factor for AD, namely depletion of circulating gonadal hormones by ovariectomy (APP/PS1 + OVX). The analyses revealed that in adult WT reelin-ir is expressed by Cajal-Retzius cells and a subgroup of interneurons throughout the hippocampal formation. In addition, layer II projection neurons in the lateral entorhinal subfields are reelin-ir. Interestingly, ovariectomy decreases the number of reelin-ir cells in the hilus in WT mice, whereas AD-related genotype alone induces only a non-significant reduction. Unexpectedly, additional stress, e.g., depletion of gonadal hormones, does not aggravate the slight reduction in the reelin cell number in the APP/PS1 mice. We propose that the changes in normal reelin-ir are linked to disturbances in repair mechanisms in which APP/PS1 and gonadal hormones are involved and which are perturbed in neurodegenerative conditions, namely AD.",

In adjacent sections of the medial septum/diagonal band of Broca (MSDB), the distribution of cell bodies expressing 5-HT 1A receptor mRNA was closely related to cells labeled with oligonucleotide probes to GAD (glutamic acid decarboxylase), VAChT (vesicular acetylcholine transporter) or parvalbumin mRNA. Using antiserum to GAD and antibodies to GABA, 5-HT 1A receptor immunoreactivity was demonstrated in a majority of GABAergic cells in the MSDB. 5-HT 1A receptor-immunoreactive GABAergic cells in the MSDB were also demonstrated to contain the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin, a marker for septohippocampal projecting GABAergic neurons. In the lateral septum, 5-HT 1A receptor immunoreactivity was colocalized with the calcium-binding protein calbindin D-28k, a marker for septal GABAergic somatospiny neurons. 5-HT 1A receptor immunoreactivity was also detected in a subpopulation of VAChT-containing cholinergic neurons of the MSDB. In MSDB neurons, colocalization of 5-HT 1A and 5-HT 2A receptor immunoreactivities was demonstrated. These observations suggest that serotonin via 5-HT 1A receptors may represent an important modulator of hippocampal transmission important for cognitive and emotional functions through actions on both GABAergic and cholinergic neurons of the rat septal complex.

The DA neurons were scattered throughout the striatum, but abounded particularly in its ventral portion. Frequency distribution of surface areas of DA cell bodies reveals that the most frequent DA neurons ( x   = 58.0%, S.D. = 12.8%) had a medium-sized (200  15 m 2) perikaryon with 35 varicose dendrites, whereas others ( x   = 35.5%, S.D. = 14.0%) had a smaller (140  15 m 2) perikaryon with 34 varicose dendrites. There was a small number ( x   = 6.5%, S.D. = 8.5%) of larger DA neurons (209584 m 2) with spiny dendrites and a few TH-immunoreactive cells displaying mixed neuron-glia morphology. Despite significant inter-individual variations in neuron density, the human striatum (mean volume of 8.76 cm 3) harbored a mean of 331.9 DA neurons (S.D. = 199.2). A prolific zone, containing about 3000 cells, occurred in the ventral striatum in two brains. The addition of these cells would increase by about 10 times the total number of striatal DA neurons, which should not be confounded with segments of nigrostriatal DA fibers that displayed large (812 m) varicosities and looked like small bipolar neurons.

We studied the induction of HSP-27 in rat brains on days 1, 4 and 14 after repeated, pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures using immunohistochemisty. Saline treated control rats showed no induction of HSP-27. HSP-27 reactive astrocytes were rarely seen 1 or 4 days after PTZ injection. When present, single astrocytes were located in the cortex and/or the hippocampus. After 14 days PTZ treatment, a bilateral distribution of HSP-27 immunoreactive glia was present in piriform and entorhinal cortices and in the dentate gyrus of most brains. Rats with most intense HSP-27 upregulation showed HSP-27 in amygdala and thalamic nuclei. Astrocytes associated with blood vessels presented strongest HSP-27 staining, but did not show upregulation of gial fibrillary acidic protein and none responded with HSP-47 expression. Additionally, HSP-27 immunoreactivity increased in the endothelial cells of blood vessels in the affected brain regions, although no neuronal induction occurred. Contrastingly, a subconvulsive dose of the glutamine synthetase inhibitor l-methionine sulfoxime, which acts directly on astrocytes, resulted in a rapid, homogeneous astrocyte-specific HSP-27 upregulation within 24 h. Thus, repeated PTZ-induced seizure activity elicits a focal heat shock response in endothelial cells and astrocytes of selected cerebral regions indicating that expression of HSP-27 occurred in a seizure-dependent manner within the affected cerebral circuitries. Therefore, this PTZ-model of repeated seizure activity exhibited a cortical pattern of HSP-27 expression which is most comparable to that known from patients with epilepsy.",

Male Wistar rats received 10 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or vehicle intraperitoneally and were sacrificed for brain collection at 4, 8 or 24 h after induction of experimental sepsis. One group of animals received 10 mg/kg of the NOS inhibitor N-monomethyl- l-arginine ( l-NMMA) intraperitoneally 1 day before and during the experiment. Immunohistochemical evaluation revealed a sepsis-induced, time-dependent increase in the immunoreactivity of iNOS, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and activated microglia (ED-1), paralleled by a time-dependent increase of apoptotic brain cells marked by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-nick end labeling (TUNEL), an increase of Bax-positive cells and a decrease of Bcl-2-positive cells. Evaluation of different brain regions revealed that the hippocampus is the most vulnerable region during experimental sepsis. iNOS-inhibition with l-NMMA significantly reduced the number of apoptotic cells in hippocampus, midbrain and cerebellum. In addition, it reduced the increase of the proapoptotic protein Bax in all examined brain regions and reduced the decrease of Bcl-2-positive cells in the hippocampus. We therefore conclude, that peripheral inflammation leads to a profound glial activation, the generation of nitric oxide and changes of Bax and Bcl-2 protein regulation critical for apoptosis.",

The type A cells resembling migrating neuroblasts were located in the superficial part of the subependymal layer, type B cells resembling glial cells were evenly distributed throughout the subependymal layer and caudate nucleus, and type C cells that resembled progenitor cells were located in the deeper regions of the subependymal layer close to the caudate nucleus. We also examined the subependymal layer in the Huntington's disease brain to determine whether neurodegenerative pathology of the caudate nucleus (adjacent to the subependymal layer) altered the cellular composition of the subependymal layer. In the Huntington's disease subependymal layer there was a significant increase in the thickness of the subependymal layer compared with the normal subependymal layer ( p < 0.01) and there was a 2.8-fold increase in the number of cells present in the Huntington's disease subependymal layer compared with the normal subependymal layer but the density of cells remained unchanged. As the grade of Huntington's disease increased, so did the overall number of cells in the subependymal layer. An increase in the number of type B cells was responsible for most of the increase demonstrated, however there was also an increase in the numbers of type A and C cells. To further characterise the human normal and Huntington's disease subependymal layer we used immunohistochemistry and antibodies against a range of projection neuron markers, interneuron markers, glial cell markers and GABA A receptor subunits. The results demonstrated the presence of increased numbers of neuropeptide Y positive cells in the Huntington's disease subependymal layer compared with the normal subependymal layer, suggesting that neuropeptide Y neurons may play a role in progenitor cell proliferation. Also there was an increased level of the developmentally active GABA A receptor subunit 2 that indicates that the adult subependymal layer still retains the ability to proliferate.

This study was aimed at testing our hypothesis that the cooperative synthesis of DA in non-dopaminergic neurons is an adaptive reaction under functional insufficiency of the dopaminergic system. Functional insufficiency of the tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic system was provoked by 6-OHDA-induced degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the arcuate nucleus in adult rats. Bienzymatic (dopaminergic) neurons and monoenzymatic neurons expressing tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) or aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) were detected with a double-immunofluorescent technique on cryostat sections. The 6-OHDA-induced degeneration of dopaminergic neurons was accompanied by a significant increase of the number of monoenzymatic TH neurons and AADC neurons that appears to support our hypothesis. The reaction of bienzymatic and monoenzymatic neuron populations to the 6-OHDA administration occurred to be region-specific. The former disappeared in the dorsomedial region of the arcuate nucleus while the latter increased in the ventrolateral region. Thus, degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the arcuate nucleus of adult rats is accompanied by the expression of individual enzymes of DA synthesis in non-dopaminergic neurons that may be an adaptive reaction.",

These modules, known as barrels, are mostly defined by the peculiar arrangement of granule cells and thalamic axons in layer IV. In the present work, we studied both the distribution and morphology of neurons stained for NADPH diaphorase (NADPH-d) and neuropil reactivity in the posteromedial barrel subfield (PMBSF), which represents the mystacial whiskers. We then compared our results with previous descriptions of NADPH-d distribution in both neonatal and young mice. We found two types of neurons in the PMBSF: type I neurons, which have large cell bodies and are heavily stained by the NADPH-d reaction; and type II neurons, characterized by relatively small and poorly stained cell bodies. The distribution of type I cells in the PMBSF was not homogenous, with cells tending to concentrate in septa between barrels. Moreover, the cells found in septal region possess both a larger and more complex dendritic arborization than cells located inside barrels. Our findings are at variance with results from other groups that reported both an absence of type II cells and a homogeneous distribution of type I cells in the PMBSF of young animals. In addition, our results show a distribution of type I cells which is very similar to that previously described for the rat's barrel field.",

We showed that the Enta, which is located within the dorsal peduncle of the lateral forebrain bundle (Pedd), has roughly topographically organized reciprocal connections with the dorsal thalamic visual nuclei, the nucleus rotundus (Rot) and dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (GLd). The Enta receives projections from visual telencephalic areas, the anterior dorsal ventricular ridge and dorsolateral cortex/pallial thickening. Most Enta neurons contained GABA and parvalbumin, and some of them were retrogradely labeled when the tracer was injected into the visual dorsal thalamic nuclei. Further experiments using double immunofluorescence revealed colocalization of GAD and parvalbumin in the vast majority of Enta neurons, and many of these cells showed retrograde labeling with Fluoro-gold injected into the Rot and/or GLd. According to these data, the Enta may be considered as a structural substrate for recurrent inhibition of the visual thalamic nuclei. Based on morphological and neurochemical similarity of the turtle Enta, caiman Pedd nucleus, the superior reticular nucleus in birds, and the thalamic reticular nucleus in mammals, we suggest that these structures represent a characteristic component which is common to the thalamic organization in amniotes.",

In the rat it has been demonstrated that olivocochlear neurons receive noradrenergic input, arising from the locus coeruleus and it has been demonstrated in this species using in vitro brain slices that noradrenaline exerts a direct, mostly excitatory effect on an olivocochlear subpopulation. The guinea pig is a more commonly used animal in auditory physiology than the rat and anatomical data on noradrenaline in the auditory brainstem in this species are lacking. Because it has been shown that a compact locus coeruleus is not present in the guinea pig, subtle species differences might be expected. Therefore, using immunohistochemical and tracing techniques we have investigated in the guinea pig (1) the noradrenergic and dopaminergic innervation of the superior olivary complex, (2) the anatomical relationship between noradrenergic fibres and olivocochlear neurons and (3) the origin of the noradrenergic input to this brainstem region. The results show that the guinea pig superior olivary complex receives moderately dense noradrenergic innervation and no dopaminergic innervation. In addition, noradrenergic fibres and varicosities were observed in close contact with both somata and dendrites of olivocochlear neurons, strongly suggestive of synaptic contacts. Finally the results show that a significant component of the noradrenergic innervation of the guinea pig superior olivary complex arises in the locus subcoeruleus, which is a structure likely to be the homologue of the locus coeruleus in rats and other species.",

The experiments were carried in two groups of animals: one group of young adult rats and a second group of aged rats. Each group of animals, depending on the diet received, was divided into high-cholesterol, high-fat, and a control diet group. In order to evaluate the interaction of A/PBS-cholesterol and of A/PBS-fat, animals without dietary manipulation receiving A and PBS injection were used as controls. High-cholesterol fed animals showed a statistically significant reduction of 49.62% in the number of cholinergic fibres at the A injection site as compared with that at PBS injection site, while the high-fat and control animals showed a significant reduction of 28.13 and 26.81%, respectively. In all diet groups, the loss of cholinergic fibres caused by A as compared to that caused by PBS injection was significantly greater in aged rats in comparison with that observed in the young animals. Furthermore, the results of a multivariate linear regression model revealed that the greatest reduction in cholinergic fibres was in the high-cholesterol fed animals (35 fibres/mm) as compared with that seen in the high-fat and control animals. A significantly greater reduction was also observed at A injection site (28 fibres/mm) as compared with that caused by PBS injection, and a reduction of 16 cholinergic fibres per mm was found in aged animals as compared to that seen in young adult rats. These results show that high-cholesterol diet enhances the toxicity of A peptide and that this is also age-dependent. Therefore, this study increases the evidences of the role of cholesterol in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD).",

Immunohistochemical methods revealed many nuclear boundaries, which were difficult to discern with Nissl staining. Parvalbumin immunoreactive somata were concentrated in the ventral posterior, reticular, posterior, lateral and medial geniculate nuclei, while parvalbumin immunoreactivity of the neuropil was present throughout all but the midline nuclei. Large numbers of calbindin immunoreactive somata were also found within the midline thalamic nuclei, and thalamic sensory relay nuclei. Immunoreactivity for calretinin was found in many small somata within the lateral geniculate a nucleus, with other labelled somata found in the lateral geniculate b nucleus, ventral posterior medial and ventral posterior lateral nuclei. Immunoreactivity with the SMI-32 antibody was largely confined to somata and neuropil within the thalamocortical relay nuclei (ventral posterior medial and lateral nuclei, lateral and medial geniculate nuclei and the posterior thalamic nucleus).

In this abstract, we only describe the results in GalOE mouse. A widespread ectopic expression of galanin (both mRNA and peptide) was found, that is a situation when neither transcript nor peptide could be seen in WT mice, not even after colchicine treatment. However, in some regions, such as claustrum, basolateral amygdala, thalamus, CA1 pyramidal cells, and Purkinje cells only galanin mRNA could be detected. In the forebrain galanin was seen in the mitral cells of the olfactory bulb, throughout the cortex, in the basolateral amygdaloid nucleus, claustrum, granular and pyramidal cell layers of the hippocampus, subiculum and presubiculum. In the thalamus, the anterodorsal, mediodorsal, intermediodorsal and mediodorsal lateral nuclei, the reuniens and reticular nuclei showed ectopic expression of galanin. Within the hypothalamus, neurons of the suprachiasmatic nucleus contained galanin. In the mesencephalon, the geniculate nucleus, nucleus ruber, the mesencephalic trigeminal and reticulotegmental nuclei ectopically expressed galanin. In the cerebellum, galanin was observed in the Purkinje cells and in the lateral and interposed cerebellar nuclei. In the pons, sensory and motor nuclei of the trigeminal nerve, the laterodorsal and dorsal tegmental nuclei, the pontine, reticulotegmental and gigantocellular reticular nuclei expressed galanin. Within the medulla oblongata, labeled cells were detected in the facial, ambiguus, prepositus, lateral paragigantocellular and lateral reticular nuclei, and spinal trigeminal nucleus. High densities of galanin-IR fibers were found in the axonal terminals of the lateral olfactory tract, the hippocampal and presumably the cerebellar mossy fibers system, in several thalamic and hypothalamic regions and the lower brain stem.

Pharmacological studies suggest that activation of neurons by nitric oxide in the NTS may involve soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC). However, anatomical data supporting this suggestion have not been available. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that neurons and fibers containing neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) lie in close proximity to those containing sGC and the two enzymes colocalize in some neurons and fibers in the NTS. We perfused six rats and obtained brain stem sections for double immunofluorescent staining utilizing antibodies selective for sGC and for nNOS combined with confocal microscopy. The distribution and staining intensity of nNOS-immunoreactivity (IR) was similar to our earlier reports. IR of sGC was present in cell bodies, proximal dendrites and fibers of many brain stem regions. Strong sGC-IR was noted in the hypoglossal, dorsal motor nucleus of vagus and gracilis nuclei. The NTS exhibited moderate sGC-IR. Superimposed images showed that many NTS neurons contained both nNOS-IR and sGC-IR. The percentage of sGC-IR positive cells that were also nNOS-IR positive differed among NTS subnuclei. Similarly, the percentage of nNOS-IR positive cells that were also sGC positive differed among NTS subnuclei. Fibers stained for both nNOS-IR and sGC-IR were also present in NTS subnuclei. In addition, we identified fibers that were stained for nNOS-IR or sGC-IR alone and often found such singly labeled fibers apposed to each other. These data support our hypothesis and provide anatomical support for the suggestion that nitroxidergic activation of the NTS involves sGC.",

The olfactostriatum projects to the main and accessory olfactory bulbs, lateral cortex, septal complex, ventral pallidum, external, ventral anterior and dorsolateral amygdalae, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, preoptic area, lateral posterior hypothalamic nucleus, ventral tegmental area, substantia nigra and raphe nuclei. Tracer injections in the nucleus accumbens proper, a structure closely associated with the olfactostriatum, result in a similar pattern of efferent connections with the exception of those reaching the main and accessory olfactory bulbs, lateral cortex, external, ventral anterior and dorsolateral amygdalae and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. These data, therefore, help to characterize the olfactostriatum, an apparently specialized area of the nucleus accumbens. Double labeling experiments after tracer injections in the nucleus sphericus and the lateral posterior hypothalamic nucleus demonstrate a pathway between these two structures through the olfactostriatum. Injections in the olfactostriatum and in the medial amygdala show parallel projections to the lateral posterior hypothalamic nucleus. Since this hypothalamic nucleus has been previously described as projecting to the hypoglossal nucleus, both, the medial amygdala and the olfactostriatum may mediate vomeronasal influence on tongue-flick behavior.",

The receptor and the enzyme were found in both neurons and glial cells in a regional and layer-specific pattern. The VDR was restricted to the nucleus whilst 1-OHase was distributed throughout the cytoplasm. The distribution of the VDR in human brain was strikingly similar to that reported in rodents. Many regions contained equivalent amounts of both the VDR and 1-OHase, however the macrocellular cells within the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) and the Purkinje cells in the cerebellum expressed 1-OHase in the absence of VDR. The strongest immunohistochemical staining for both the receptor and enzyme was in the hypothalamus and in the large (presumably dopaminergic) neurons within the substantia nigra. The observed distribution of the VDR is consistent with the proposal that Vitamin D operates in a similar fashion to the known neurosteroids. The widespread distribution of 1-OHase and the VDR suggests that Vitamin D may have autocrine/paracrine properties in the human brain.",

However, it is not clear which neurons express these markers, namely the ones that project to the retina rather than in neurons that only participate in a local circuit. Therefore, to characterize the neurochemical patterns of the centrifugal visual system in the post-hatched chick, retinopetal cells of the isthmo-optic nuclei and the ectopic region were identified via immunolabeling for cholera toxin, a neuronal tracer, which has been injected in the ocular globe. Then, double labeled with acetylcholinesterase histochemistry to reveal cholinergic synapses, or NADPH-diaphorase histochemistry as a nitrergic marker. Briefly, acetylcholinesterase activity was present mainly in cholera toxin labeled cell bodies of the isthmo-optic nucleus and the ectopic region indicating that retinal projecting neurons of centrifugal visual system comprise a cholinoceptive pathway. On the other hand, NADPH-diaphorase histochemistry was present in the neuropile and sparse cell bodies inside of the isthmo-optic nucleus and in ectopic neurons which were not cholera toxin positive suggesting their role in an intrinsic circuit of the centrifugal visual system. These data support the idea that these two neurochemical systems are present in distinct neuronal populations in the centrifugal visual system.",

However, many of these proteins are unfolded or misfolded by extracellular or intracellular stimuli. The accumulation of misfolded proteins constitutes a risk for living cells. Eukaryotic cells possess at least three different mechanisms to adapt to ER stress and thereby survive: (1) translational attenuation to limit further accumulation of misfolded proteins; (2) transcriptional activation of genes encoding ER-resident chaperones; and (3) the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway to restore the folding capacity. If the cells are exposed to prolonged or strong ER stress, the cells are destroyed by apoptosis. Recent evidence indicates that ER stress signaling pathways are mediated in part by several protein kinases and play an important role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. The main purpose of this review is to summarize current knowledge about the protein kinases involved in ER stress, and their involvement in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders.",

This study aimed to investigate the possible presence of nitrergic neurons in human the septal region in greater detail. After having studied a total of 16 postmortem human brains we conclude that the immunohistochemical demonstration of nitric oxide synthase in human septal neurons is largely dependent on the mode of tissue handling: in brain specimens which were fixed en-bloc with paraffin and embedded in paraplast, nitric oxide synthase immunoreactivity is barely detectable, whereas a satisfying immunostaining is obtained on free-floating frozen sections after an immersionfixation with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.5% glutaraldehyde, followed by sucrose protection of the specimens.

We also analysed the connections in the area ventralis tegmentalis and the substantia nigra. To label the dopaminergic structures, anti-tyrosine hydroxylase was used and DARPP-32 (dopamine and cAMP regulated phosphoprotein) was a marker of dopaminoceptive elements. The tyrosine hydroxylase positive fibres formed baskets of juxtapositions around the DARPP-32 containing cells of the medial striatum. However, such baskets were also observed to juxtapose DARPP-32 immunonegative cells. In the tegmentum, DARPP-32 was observed in axons descending from the telencephalon via the ansa lenticularis. These varicose fibers innervated the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra and were often juxtaposed to dopaminergic neurons and dendrites. Approximately 40% of the striatal projection neurons targeting the ventral tegmentum, and 60% of striatal projection neurons targeting the nigra were immunoreactive to DARPP-32, as revealed by retrograde pathway tracing with Fast Blue. Endogenous dopamine may exert a retrograde synaptic effect on the afferent striato-tegmental fibers, apart from the reported extrasynaptic action.

In the rat, FAAH-immunoreactivity has been detected in epithelial cells of the choroid plexus and, in accordance with this finding, here we report FAAH mRNA expression in rat choroid plexus epithelium using in situ hybridisation methods. Surprisingly, a comparative analysis of mouse brain did not reveal FAAH mRNA expression or FAAH-immunoreactivity in the choroid plexus of this species. FAAH-immunoreactivity was, however, detected in non-choroidal ventricular ependymal cells in the mouse brain and the specificity of this immunostaining was confirmed by analysis of FAAH-knockout mice. FAAH-immunoreactivity was detected in ependymal cells throughout the ventricles of the mouse brain but with regional variation in the intensity of immunostaining. Intriguingly, in rat brain, although FAAH expression is observed in choroid plexus epithelial cells, little or no FAAH-immunoreactivity is present in the ventricular ependyma. Thus, there are mutually exclusive patterns of FAAH expression in the ventricular epithelium of rat and mouse brain.

Triple labelling for pChAT/cChAT/neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) revealed 19.7% of 1664 neurons (within 40 ganglia) to be immunoreactive exclusively for pChAT whereas 29.6% were positive for cChAT alone and 18.8% were reactive only for nNOS.

To investigate the presence and possible colocalization of the above markers within morphologically defined neuron types, triple labelling of cChAT or nNOS with pChAT and a neurofilament (NF) antibody pool was applied and the coexpression patterns of pChAT and cChAT as well as of pChAT and nNOS in 120 neurons of each type were recorded. All type I, II, IV and V neurons displayed immunoreactivity either for one or both cholinergic markers. These neuron types were considered to be cholinergic.

In this study, immunoreactivity for these two receptors was investigated in rat spinal neurones retrogradely labelled by injections of cholera toxin B or Fluorogold into the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS). In addition, nociceptive activation of these labelled cells was studied by immunodetection of Fos protein in response to cutaneous and visceral noxious chemical stimuli. NK1 and sst2 A receptors in lamina I were localised to mainly separate populations of retrogradely labelled cells with fusiform, flattened and pyramidal morphologies. Examples of projection neurones expressing both receptors were, however observed. With visceral stimulation, many retrogradely labelled cells expressing c-fos were immunoreactive for the NK1 receptor, and a smaller population was sst2 A positive. In contrast, with cutaneous stimulation, only NK1 positive retrogradely labelled cells showed c-fos expression. These data provide evidence that lamina I neurones receiving noxious cutaneous and visceral stimuli via NK1 receptor activation project to NTS and so may be involved in coordinating nociceptive and cardiorespiratory responses.

        "des": "Nearly all resident proteins of the organelles along the secretory pathway, as well as proteins that are expressed at the cell surface or secreted from the cell, are first co-translationally translocated into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as unfolded polypeptide chains. Immediately after entering the ER, they are often modified with N-linked glycans, are folded into the appropriate secondary and tertiary structures, which are stabilized by disulfide bonds, and finally in many cases are assembled into multimeric complexes. These processes are aided and monitored by ER chaperones and folding enzymes. When cells experience conditions that alter the ER environment, protein folding can be dramatically affected and can lead to the accumulation of unfolded proteins in this organelle. This in turn activates a signaling response, which is shared among all eukaryotic organisms, termed the unfolded protein response (UPR). The hallmark of this response is the coordinate transcriptional up-regulation of ER chaperones and folding enzymes. A major role for the increased levels of chaperones and folding enzymes during conditions of ER stress is to provide the same functions they carry out during normal physiological conditions. This includes preventing unfolded and incompletely folded proteins from aggregating and promoting the proper folding and assembly of proteins in the ER. During conditions of ER stress, many proteins are unable to fold properly and the requirements for chaperones are therefore increased. However, more recently it has become clear that some ER chaperones are also involved in signaling the ER stress response, targeting misfolded proteins for degradation and perhaps even shutting down the UPR when the stress subsides. In addition, during some normal physiological conditions, like plasma cell differentiation where there is an increased demand in the secretory capacity of B cells, the levels of various ER chaperones are also up-regulated via at least part of the UPR pathway. In order to discuss these various functions of ER chaperones, we will begin with the roles of ER chaperones and folding enzymes during normal physiological conditions and then discuss their roles during ER stress.",

Also, the recent description of the extensive ET-1 mRNA localisation in human neural tissue supports expression in regions of human brain not previously investigated.

Neuronal staining for ET-1 was demonstrated within the diencephalon, brainstem, basal nuclei, cerebral cortex, cerebellar hemisphere, amygdala and hippocampus. In addition, ET-1 immunolabelling was visualised in the pituitary gland as well as in the choroid plexus. The primary sensory cortex and pineal gland also contained immunoreactive ET-1, although ET-1 mRNA had never been detected in these regions previously.

While the levels of each specific subunit mRNA were relatively homogeneously distributed throughout the five hippocampal subregions analyzed (CA14, and the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus), mRNA expression of the 1 receptor subunit was found to be 20% reduced in the moderate cognitive impairment group as compared to the no cognitive impairment group.

The core regions of different islands appear to be continuous with each other so as to form a complex three-dimensional structure, which is largely encased by layers of granule cells. The neuronal elements in the islands of Calleja, which express m4 receptors, remain to be identified, but it is unlikely that cholinergic neurons are a major locus of these receptors.

Adult rats were subjected to unilateral vagus and hypoglossal nerve transection, following which half of the animals were kept in an altitude chamber ( PO 2 = 380 Torr). The immunoexpression of CGRP and ChAT (CGRP-IR/ChAT-IR) were examined by quantitative immunohistochemistry at 3, 7, 14, 30 and 60 days post-axotomy. The results revealed that CGRP-IR in the HN was increased at 3 days but decreased to basal levels at 7 days following nerve injury. The decline was followed by a second rise in CGRP-IR at 30 days post-axotomy, followed again by a return to basal levels at 60 days. In the NA, CGRP-IR was up-regulated at 3 days and remained increased for up to 60 days after nerve injury. Animals treated with a double injury showed a greater CGRP-IR than normoxic group in both nuclei at all post-axtomized periods. In contrast to CGRP, ChAT-IR was markedly reduced in the HN and NA at 3 days reaching its nadir at 14 days following nerve injury. Hypoxic animals showed a stronger reduction of ChAT-IR in both nuclei at all post-axtomized periods. Results of cell counting showed that neuronal loss was somewhat obvious in hypoxic HN than that of normoxic ones. The present results suggest that up-regulation of CGRP-IR may exert its trophic effects while down-regulation of ChAT-IR may correlate with the poor neurotransmission within the injured neurons. It is speculated that the enhanced expression of CGRP-IR and the pronounced reduction of ChAT-IR in hypoxic rats may result from a drastic shift of intracellular metabolic pathways, which in turn could lead to more metabolic loading to the severely damaged neurons following the double insult.",

The extrabulbar olfactory system was observed already at stage 45, which is the first developmental stage compatible with our techniques; at this stage, the extrabulbar olfactory system fibers terminated diffusely in the preoptic area.

Inhibition of protein glycosylation, perturbation of calcium homeostasis, and reduction of disulfide bonds provoke accumulation of unfolded protein in the ER, and are called ER stress. Normal cells respond to ER stress by increasing transcription of genes encoding ER-resident chaperones such as GRP78/BiP, to facilitate protein folding or by suppressing the mRNA translation to synthesize proteins. These systems are termed the unfolded protein response (UPR). Familial Alzheimers disease-linked presenilin-1 (PS1) mutation downregulates the unfolded protein response and leads to vulnerability to ER stress. The mechanisms by which mutant PS1 affects the ER stress response are attributed to the inhibited activation of ER stress transducers such as IRE1, PERK and ATF6. On the other hand, in sporadic Alzheimers disease (sAD), we found the aberrant splicing isoform (PS2V), generated by exon 5 skipping of the Presenilin-2 (PS2) gene transcript, responsible for induction of high mobility group A1a protein (HMGA1a). The PS2V also downregulates the signaling pathway of the UPR, in a similar fashion to that reported for mutants of PS1 linked to familial AD. It was clarified what molecules related to cell death are activated in the case of AD and we discovered that caspase-4 plays a key role in ER stress-induced apoptosis. Caspase-4 also seems to act upstream of the -amyloid-induced ER stress pathway, suggesting that activation of caspase-4 might mediate neuronal cell death in AD.",

Conspicuous immunoreactivity was seen in the olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), their projections in the olfactory nerve, fascicles of the olfactory nerve layer in the periphery of bulb and in the medial olfactory tracts as they extend to the telencephalic lobes. Ablation of the olfactory organ resulted in loss of immunoreactivity in the olfactory nerve layer of the bulb and also in the fascicles of the medial olfactory tracts. This evidence suggests that NPY may serve as a neurotransmitter in the ORNs and convey chemosensory information to the olfactory bulb, and also to the telencephalon over the extrabulbar projections. In addition, network of beaded immunoreactive fibers was noticed throughout the olfactory bulb, which did not respond to ablation experiment. These fibers may represent centrifugal innervation of the bulb. Strong immunoreactivity was encountered in some ganglion cells of nervus terminalis. Immunoreactive fibers and terminal fields were widely distributed in the telencephalon. Several neurons of nucleus entopeduncularis were moderately immunoreactive; and a small population of neurons in nucleus preopticus periventricularis was also labeled.

As the first step, nitric oxide synthase immunohistochemistry was used to distinguish nitric oxide synthase-immunoreactive staining of the ventral motor nucleus. Dense, punctate nitric oxide synthase immunoreactivity was found on control sections in the neuropil of the ventral motor nucleus. After hemisection at Th1011, axotomy-induced retrograde changes consisting in a strong upregulation of nitric oxide synthase-containing neurons were found mostly unilaterally in lamina VIII, the medial part of lamina VII and in the pericentral region in all segments of the lumbosacral enlargement. Concurrently, a strong depletion of the punctate nitric oxide synthase immunopositivity in the neuropil of the ventral motor nucleus ipsilaterally with the hemisection was detected, thus revealing that an uncrossed ascending premotor propriospinal pathway containing a fairly high number of nitric oxide synthase-immunoreactive fibers terminates in the ventral motor nucleus. Application of the retrograde fluorescent tracer Fluorogold injected into the ventral motor nucleus and analysis of alternate sections processed for nitric oxide synthase immunocytochemistry revealed the presence of Fluorogold-labeled and nitric oxide synthase-immunoreactive axons in the ventrolateral funiculus and in the lateral and medial portions of the ventral column throughout the thoracic and upper lumbar segments.

Using cresyl violet counterstaining and double immunohistochemical staining for glial or neuronal markers (GFAp, CAII and NeuN), we show that two limited populations of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes cell bodies and processes are immunoreactive for GLUT2, whereas a cross-reaction with GLUT1 cannot be ruled out.

The latter were clustered in the dorsal endopiriform nucleus and neighboring temporal and perirhinal cortex, in the dorsal amygdaloid region, and in the paraventricular and reuniens thalamic nuclei, whereas they were only a few in the hypothalamus. Moreover, a group of GLUT2-immunoreactive nerve cell bodies was localized in the dorsal medulla oblongata while some large multipolar nerve cell bodies peripherally labeled for GLUT2 were scattered in the caudal ventral reticular formation. This anatomical localization of GLUT2 appears characteristic and different from that reported for the neuronal transporter GLUT3 and GLUT4. Indeed, the possibility that GLUT2 may be localized in the sub-plasmalemnal region of neurones and/or in afferent nerve fibres remains to be confirmed by ultrastructural observations. Because of the neuronal localization of GLUT2, and of its distribution relatively similar to glucokinase, it may be hypothesized that this transporter is, at least partially, involved in cerebral glucose sensing.",

We examined their ontogeny and distribution in the fetal, postnatal and adult human IOC by immunohistochemistry. At 1112 weeks of gestation (wg), calbindin immunoreactivity was present in the principal olive and the medial accessory olive, it was absent in the dorsal olive. Parvalbumin immunoreactivity developed at 1617 wg in the ventral lamella and the lateral bulge of the principal olive only. Calbindin expression gradually increased from 20 to 37 wg, whilst by contrast, parvalbumin expression was moderate. By 37 wg, all three IOC subnuclei were immunopositive for both proteins. In a 3-month-old infant, parvalbumin was intensely developed in the olivary axons. In the adults (40- to 59-year-old), calbindin was distributed in most neurons, and olivocerebellar fibres, whereas parvalbumin was present in some neurons and few fibres.

In the mammalian brain all four regulatory isoforms (RI and , RII and ) are present. Apparently, they are simple inhibitors of the catalytic subunits. It is still unclear why four isoforms are needed, but possibly they can target kinase activity at precise intracellular locations. Therefore, we examined the distribution of the insoluble regulatory isoforms in rat and mouse brains during prenatal (from embryonic day 8) and postnatal development up to senescence (13 months), via immunohistochemistry. RII labelling is always restricted to the ventricular ependyma. Punctated RII labelling is observed in the embryo from early stages of development, and is mainly localized in the cortical plate. After birth, punctate RII labelling is present throughout almost the whole brain, often observed in proximity of neurofilaments. It shows different characteristics and relationships to the other isoforms: for example in the CA1 hippocampal field, RII is substituted by RI 2 weeks after birth, while in CA2 it persists for life. In other regions, as in the reticular formation, RII and RI aggregates are found in the same cell, although clearly segregated. The different regulatory isoforms show distinct patterns of distribution that change consistently during development. A careful characterization of second messenger systems may be as useful as the study of neurotransmitters to understand neuronal properties and their modifications during development, so as to relate biochemical to functional properties.",

CBF neurons provide the major cholinergic innervation to the hippocampus, amygdala and neocortex. They play a role in cognition and attentional behaviors, and are dysfunctional in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The human CBF displays a continuum of large cells that contain various cholinergic markers, nerve growth factor (NGF) and its cognate receptors, calbindin, glutamate receptors, and the estrogen receptors, ER and ER. Admixed with these cholinergic neuronal phenotypes are smaller interneurons containing the m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChRs), NADPH-diaphorase, GABA, calcium binding proteins and several inhibitory neuropeptides including galanin (GAL), which is over expressed in AD. Studies using human autopsy material indicate an age-related dissociation of calbindin and the glutamate receptor GluR2 within CBF neurons, suggesting that these molecules act synergistically to induce excitotoxic cell death during aging, and possibly during AD. Choline acetyltrasnferease (ChAT) activity and CBF neuron number is preserved in the cholinergic basocortical system and up regulated in the septohippocampal system during prodromal as compared with end stage AD. In contrast, the number of CBF neurons containing NGF receptors is reduced early in the disease process suggesting a phenotypic silence and not a frank loss of neurons. In end stage AD, there is a selective reduction in trkA mRNA but not p75 NTR in single CBF cells suggesting a neurotrophic defect throughout the progression of AD. These observations indicate the complexity of the chemoanatomy of the human CBF and suggest that multiple factors play different roles in its dysfunction in aging and AD.",

Little is known about the distribution and binding characteristics of amylin receptors in species other than rat; therefore, in this study, by using in vitro autoradiography, we have mapped the distribution of 125 I-rat amylin binding sites in the monkey brain and compared this distribution to that of binding sites for 125 I-salmon CT ( 125 I-sCT). Highest densities of 125 I-amylin binding were in the hypothalamus, including the arcuate nucleus and parts of the ventromedial hypothalamic nuclei, and the solitary nucleus. Rostrally, moderate to high density binding was present in parts of the preoptic area, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, amygdala and accumbens nucleus (Acb). Caudally, binding of amylin was more restricted, with moderate to high density binding present only in dorsal raphe, and area postrema. The primary visual cortex displayed strong and periodic CT binding in layer 4. The subcortical pattern of distribution of amylin and CT receptors in the monkey was similar to that seen previously in the rat, although the relative densities of binding to different brain structures were not always conserved. As with rat, monkey amylin receptors were a subset of the sites labeled with 125 I-sCT. Analysis of receptor specificity indicated a greater relative potency of CT peptides in competing for 125 I-amylin binding in monkey, when compared to rat, while, there was a decrease in the relative potency of CT gene-related peptides, potentially due to differences the level of receptor activity modifying proteins (RAMPs) in monkey versus rat brain. Amylin receptors in primates are likely to perform a similar role to those in rats; however, the interaction of the receptors with related peptides may differ.",

Although localisation of these components in rodent brain has been extensively investigated, no single study has mapped their distribution in human brain. Here we describe the localisation of ET-1 mRNA, ET-1, ECE-1, ET A and ET B receptors within 24 human brain regions. In situ RT-PCR has previously detected ET-1 mRNA in 22 areas (excluding the post-central gyrus and pineal gland), and ET-1 immunoreactivity was visualised in cells of all regions. Using specific antibodies we have immunolocalised ECE-1 and ET B receptors in cells of 24 areas, and ET A receptors in nine regions (choroidal epithelial cells, neurones in the diencephalon, hippocampus, amygdaloid, dentate nucleus, Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, flocculo-nodular lobe and vermis).

The survival of viable tissue affected by secondary injury largely depends on the balance between endogenous protective mechanisms and the ongoing degenerative processes. The inducible enzyme, heme oxygenase-1 metabolizes and thus detoxifies free heme to the powerful endogenous antioxidants biliverdin and bilirubin therefore enhancing neuroprotection. The secosteroid 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 (1,25-D 3) is a modulator of the immune system and also exhibits a strong potential for neuroprotection as recently shown in the MCAO model of cerebral ischemia. We studied the effects of 1,25-D 3 treatment on heme oxygenase-1 expression following focal cortical ischemia elicited by photothrombosis. Postlesional treatment with 1,25-D 3 (4 g/kg body weight) resulted in a transient, but significant upregulation of glial heme oxygenase-1 immunoreactivity concomitant with a reduction in glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity in remote cortical regions affected by a secondary spread of injury, whereas the size of the lesions core remained unaffected. 1,25-D 3 did not produce a temporal shift or extension of injury-related heme oxygenase-1 responses, indicating that 1,25-D 3 did not prolong ischemia-related heme oxygenase-1 expression. In contrast to glial heme oxygenase-1 upregulation, glial fibrillary acidic protein, a sensitive marker for reactive gliosis, was significantly reduced. These findings support an additional protective action of 1,25-D 3 at the cellular level in regions affected by secondary injury-related responses.",

Oral 5-HTP administration increased the intensity of both 5-HTP and serotonin immunoreactivity in raphe neurons. However, 5-HTP treatment also caused ectopic 5-hydroxytryptophan-immunoreactivity and serotonin-immunoreactivity in normally dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra par compacta. Serotonin-immunoreactivity was confined to neurons that also displayed amino acid decarboxylase immunoreactivity, but in a small percentage of substantia nigra neurons, serotonin immunoreactivity was not co-localized with tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactivity. The intensity of the immunoreactivity to serotonin and 5-hydroxytryptophan in the substantia nigra was maximal within 2 h of 5-hydroxytryptophan administration and returned to control levels by 24 h. This time course mirrored changes in HPLC measurements of 5-hydroxytryptophan, serotonin, and the metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in the urine. 5-Hydroxytryptophan administration did not cause ectopic appearance of either serotonin or 5-hydroxytryptophan in the noradrenergic locus coeruleus.

In the present study we compared the development of H/O and MCH-expressing neuronal populations with in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry on adjacent sections in the embryonic and postnatal rat brain. We found that MCH mRNA and protein were present in developing neurons of the hypothalamus by embryonic day 16 (E16), whereas H/O mRNA and protein were not detected until E18. We also identified previously undescribed populations of MCH-immunoreactive cells in the lateral septum, paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, lateral zona incerta, and ventral lateral geniculate nucleus that may play a specific role in the development of these regions. MCH immunoreactive axonal processes were also evident earlier than H/O stained fibers and at the time H/O immunoreactive processes were first identified in the hypothalamus at E20, extensive MCH axonal fiber systems were already present in many brain regions. Interestingly, however, the density of axonal fibers immunoreactive for H/O in the locus coeruleus reached peak levels at the same developmental age (P21) as MCH immunoreactive axons in the diagonal band of Broca (DBB). The peak of axon density coincided with the developmental stage at which adult patterns of feeding and sleepwaking activity become established. The present results demonstrate developmental differences and similarities between the MCH and H/O systems that may relate to their respective roles in feeding and sleep regulation.",

Loss of fibers in both subdivisions of the substantia nigra was also already great by grade 1. By contrast, the loss in the striatal projection system to the internal segment of globus pallidus proceeded more gradually.

The distribution of ARO-ir and of NADPH-positive cells in the forebrain observed here matched exactly the distribution previously reported. The distribution of NOS-immunoreactive material in the vicinity of ARO-ir cell groups appeared similar to the distribution of NADPH-positive structures previously identified by histochemistry. The number of NOS-immunoreactive cells was similar to the number of NADPH-positive cells and they were found in the same brain regions. In contrast, few NOS-immunoreactive fibers were observed whereas numerous NADPH-positive fibers and punctuate structures were present in many areas. Major groups of NOS-immunoreactive/NADPH-positive neurons were adjacent to the main ARO-ir cell groups, such as the medial preoptic nucleus, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and the nucleus ventromedialis hypothalamic. However, examination of adjacent sections indicated that there is very little overlap between the NOS-immunoreactive and ARO-ir cell populations. This notion got further support by double-labeled sections where no double-labeled cells could be identified. In sections stained simultaneously by histochemistry for NADPH and immunohistochemistry for ARO, many NADPH-positive fibers and punctate structures were closely associated with ARO-ir perikarya. Taken together, the present data indicate that NOS is not or very rarely colocalized with ARO but that NOS inputs are closely associated with ARO-ir cells.

Confocal laser scanning microscopy showed that 883% of TRD-labeled SSN neurons contained NMDAR1-immunoreactivity (IR). The surrounding neuropil contained numerous fibers labeled for VGLUT2-IR, but not VGLUT1-IR. Double fluorescent immunohistochemistry for NMDAR1 and VGLUT2 revealed that fibers containing VGLUT2-IR were often in close proximity to cell bodies or proximal dendrites of TRD-labeled SSN neurons that were positive for NMDAR1-IR. These studies support our hypothesis that NMDA receptors and VGLUT are present in the SSN.

Since hypoxic stress would drastically influence the cardiorespiratory function, the present study aimed to examine if the expression of nNOS and NMDA receptor subunit 1 (NMDAR1) in the nodose ganglion (NG) would alter under different extents of hypoxia treatment. The nicotinamine adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase (NADPH-d) histochemistry, nNOS and NMDAR1 immunofluorescence were used to examine nNOS and NMDAR1 expression in the NG following exposing of adult rats in the altitude chamber (0.27 atm, P o 2 =43 torr) for 2 and 4 h. The present results showed that NADPH-d, nNOS and NMDAR1 reactivities were co-localized in the NG under normoxic and hypoxic environment. Quantitative evaluation revealed that about 43% of neurons in the NG showed positive response for NADPH-d/nNOS and NMDAR1 reactivities. However, in animals subjected to hypoxia, both the percentage and the staining intensity of NADPH-d/nNOS and NMDAR1 labeled neurons were drastically increased. The percentage of NADPH-d/nNOS and NMDAR1-immunoreactive neurons in the NG was raised to 68% as well as 77%, respectively, following 2 and 4 h of hypoxic exposure. The magnitude of up-regulation was positively correlated with the duration of hypoxic periods. No significant cell loss was observed under this experimental paradigm. These findings suggest that different extents of hypoxia might induce the higher expression of nNOS and NMDAR1 in the NG, which could contribute to the neuronal integration as responding to the different physiological demands under hypoxic stress.",

The distribution of S100-like immunoreactivity was analyzed by three different antisera: a polyclonal, against S100 protein, and two monoclonals, against the -subunit (S100) and the -subunit (S100) of this protein. All sera showed glial positive elements, which were more abundant in the brainstem than in the prosencephalon. Moreover, the polyclonal and the monoclonal antibodies against the -subunit evidenced a neuronal population with a wide distribution, variable morphology and staining intensity. In the telencephalon and diencephalon a few S100-positive neurons were observed in basal ganglia, nucleus paraventricularis hypothalami, nucleus rotundus and nucleus geniculatus lateralis, pars ventralis. In the mesencephalon and pons a wide S100-immunoreactive neuronal population was detected in several regions, including motor and sensory nuclei of most cranial nerves (i.e. oculomotoris, abducens, trigeminus, cochlearis, trochlearis and vestibularis nuclei). This distribution appears very similar to that previously described in the rat hindbrain by both immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization, as well as to sparse observations on different vertebrates.

In many cases the stimuli that generate these disparate responses are tens of seconds or more in length, much greater than the typical time-courses of calcium dynamics. In this paper I propose that the synaptic signaling network can perform temporal computation operations such as tuning for stimulus duration or interval. Using simulation methods I show that the simple time-courses of individual signaling pathways combine in the network to give rise to different temporally selective responses.

All histaminergic neurons are found in the tuberomamillary nucleus (TM), and send axons to almost all parts of the CNS. Despite the obvious importance of these neurons, their development, transmitter storage, and compartmentalization of cotransmitters are poorly known. Histaminergic neurons from fetal rat hypothalamus were studied in primary explant cultures and analyzed by confocal microscopy. Most histaminergic neurons were oval in shape, but round and triangular ones were also found. The average size of the 212 analyzed neurons was 19.2 m (length), 12.5 m (width) and 11.7 m (thickness). The cells possessed two to five microtubule-associated protein (MAP2) positive processes, putative dendrites, and in general one MAP2-negative thin process, a putative axon. Granular histamine-immunoreactivity was found in the cell bodies, axons, and dendrites. In tuberomamillary neurons, most histamine-containing structures displayed immunoreactivity for vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), indicating that the two markers may coexist in the same structures. Lack of VMAT2 in some histamine-immunoreactive structures indicates that another transporter for histamine may exist. In the same neurons, -aminobutyric acid (GABA)-immunoreactivity was found in structures, distinct from those containing histamine, indicating that the two transmitters may be differentially localized, regulated and released. Galanin-immunoreactivity in the cultured tuberomamillary neurons was partially located in the same structures as VMAT2. The results suggest that histamine and GABA, the two principal transmitters of tuberomamillary neurons, are not costored in the same structures in tuberomamillary neurons.",

Calbindin was the calcium-binding protein showing the highest expression in the claustrum and the endopiriform nucleus. In contrast, calretinin-immunoreactive structures, particularly cell bodies, were very scarce in these regions. Both calbindin-immunoreactive and parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons were more abundant in the claustrum than in the endopiriform nucleus, and more in rostral than in caudal levels. Nevertheless, calcium-binding protein immunoreactive neurons constitute a minority population of claustral neurons. The colocalization study of calbindin and parvalbumin immunoreactivities has demonstrated that both calcium-binding proteins are mostly expressed by separate claustral neurons in the mouse. On the other hand, our results on parvalbumin and calretinin immunoreactivity match a novel subdivision of the mouse claustrum mostly based on the pattern of cadherin expression [Neuroscience 106 (2001) 505]. In this sense, we propose that a specific zone of the dorsal claustrum with cell bodies that strongly express Rcad and cadherin-8 would be the selective target for parvalbumin-expressing fibers, and that they would be mostly avoided by calretinin-expressing axons.",

In situ end-labeling revealed significant numbers of dying nigral neurons ipsilateral to the lesion during the first 3 weeks following injection. An indication of the gradual nature of death was that similar small numbers of cells were detected at each time point. These early morphological markers of neuronal death led to a significant reduction (20%) at 5 months of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons and total number of neurons in the ipsilateral substantia nigra compared with the contralateral control. To examine the role of nigrostriatal DA metabolism in the observed nigral neuronal death, we manipulated DA metabolism during the initial 2 weeks following kainic acid lesion. Neurons in the ventral tier of the substantia nigra pars compacta were protected from death by treatment with 2,4-diamino-6-hydroxy-pyrimidine (DAHP), an inhibitor of GTP cyclohydrolase, the initial enzyme in the synthesis of the tyrosine hydroxylase co-substrate, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH 4 ). Neurons in both the dorsal and ventral tier of substantia nigra pars compacta were protected from death by treatment with DAHP and l -DOPA.

Thus, we have to assume divergent effects on both hemispheres. This study represents an attempt to test the hypothesis that embryonic light asymmetry induces different, cell-type-specific effects in the left and the right optic midbrain. Since it is likely that inhibitory interneurons play a critical role in the establishment of asymmetries, we examined in both sides of the brain the soma sizes of GABA- and parvalbumin- (PV) immunoreactive (ir) cells of the tectum and the magnocellular isthmic nucleus in controls and in dark-incubated animals. No cell size asymmetries of magnocellular isthmic neurons were found in either dark-incubated or control birds. Dark-incubation also prevented the establishment of lateralized differences in GABAergic and PV-positive tectal cells. However, in control birds GABAergic cells displayed larger somata in the left tectum, whereas PV-ir neurons were enlarged within the right tectum. This complementary asymmetry pattern suggests that PV- and GABA-ir tectal cells represent different cellular populations which react differently to visual input. Thus, our data show that visual lateralization does not result from a mere growth promoting effect that enhances differentiation within the behaviorally dominant left side, but is constituted by different cell type-specific circuits which are divergently adjusted in the left and in the right tectum.",

The serotonergic neurons are their main neuronal components, although a proportion of them lie in subdivisions of the lateral reticular formation. They develop from mesopontine and medullary primordia, and the resulting grouping into rostral and caudal clusters is maintained into adulthood, and is reflected in the connectivity. Thus, the mesencephalon and rostral pons, neurons within the rostral raphe complex (caudal linear, dorsal raphe, and median raphe nuclei) project primarily to the forebrain. By contrast, in the caudal pons and medulla oblongata, neurons within the caudal raphe complex (raphe magnus, raphe obscurus, raphe pallidus nuclei and parts of the adjacent lateral reticular formation) project to the brainstem nuclei and to the spinal cord. The median raphe and dorsal raphe nuclei provide parallel and overlapping projections to many forebrain structures with axon fibers exhibiting distinct structural and functional characteristics. The caudal group of the serotonergic system projects to the brainstem, and, by three parallel projections, to the dorsal, intermediate and ventral columns in the spinal cord. The serotonergic axons arborize over large areas comprising functionally diverse targets. Some projections form classical chemical synapses while many do not, thus contributing to the so-called paracrine or volume transmission . The serotonergic projections participate in the regulation of different functional (motor, somatosensory, limbic) systems; and have been associated with a wide range of neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders. Finally, recent experimental data support the role of serotonin in modulating brain development, such that a dysfunction in serotonergic transmission during early life could lead to long lasting structural and functional alterations.",

It also reports recent functional calcium-imaging data obtained in rat brain slices, as well as developmental results gathered with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) in monkeys. On one hand, single-axon tracing studies in rats and monkeys have revealed that the majority of striatofugal axon arborizes within most striatal target structures. In humans, SP-positive fibers were found to arborize in the two segments of the globus pallidus, where they were closely apposed to pallidal neurons that expressed the neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1r). In agreement with such findings, calcium-imaging studies in rats have revealed that pallidal and nigral neurons are both responsive to SP. These findings suggest that the striatofugal projection system is much more widely distributed than previously thought and exerted a multifaceted effect upon its target sites. On the other hand, immunostaining studies in humans have shown the presence of several types of putative dopaminergic neurons intrinsic to the striatum. Furthermore, BrdU labeling experiments in monkeys have demonstrated that new neurons are generated throughout adult life in the striatum of normal monkeys and that their number can be markedly increased by the administration of neuronal growth factors. These findings open new therapeutic avenues for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders that specifically affect the striatum.",

On the other hand, several specific features of DARPP-32 distribution in the gekkonid brain were noted that deserved further attention, e.g. cellular co-localization of DARPP-32 and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity in hypothalamic and caudal rhombencephalic areas. To assess the primitive or derived character of these features, DARPP-32 and TH antibodies have been applied to the brain of the turtle, Pseudemys scripta elegans , which belongs to a different radiation of reptiles. Areas in Pseudemys that are densely innervated by TH-immunoreactive fibers, such as the striatum and amygdaloid complex, display strong immunoreactivity for DARPP-32 in somata and neuropil. Strongly immunoreactive fiber plexuses were found in the substantia nigra pars reticulata and in the ventromedial part of the rhombencephalon. Cellular co-localization of DARPP-32 and TH was observed in the ventral hypothalamus but, in contrast to Gekko , not at caudal rhombencephalic levels. Moreover, cellular DARPP-32 immunoreactivity was not seen in the raphe nuclei and spinal cord of Pseudemys . Other notable species differences in DARPP-32 distribution were found in the olfactory bulb, dorsal ventricular ridge and pretectum. In conclusion, the present account on the distribution of DARPP-32 in Pseudemys confirms and extends previous findings in a gekkonid lizard.

Given the physiological and perceptual distinctions among the different sensory modalities, it might be expected that the contribution of GABA-ergic inhibition to the process would vary from area to area, depending on the sensory modality represented. Furthermore, as receptive field properties become progressively more complex at higher cortical levels, differences in the inhibitory contributions to these computations would be reflected in differences in GABA-ergic neuronal distribution. These possibilities were examined in the cortices surrounding the cat Anterior Ectosylvian Sulcus (AES) which contains higher order visual (AEV), somatosensory (SIV) and auditory (Field AES) representations, and is located between the lower-level primary (AI) and secondary auditory (AII) and somatosensory (SII) areas. Using standard immunocytochemical and light-microscopic techniques, the distribution of GABA-ergic neurons (and their co-localized calcium-binding proteins: calbindin (CB), calretinin (CR) and parvalbumin (PV)) was determined for each area. When normalized for differences in cortical thickness, the depth distribution of each of the immunopositive types was plotted. These data confirmed that there were striking differences in the distribution of GABA-, CB-, CR- and PV-positive neurons. However, the laminar organization for a given marker was remarkably similar for the different subregions, irrespective of modality or hierarchical level.

The destruction of catecholaminergic (CA) terminals in the POA produced a decrease in sleep in rats. This effect was shown to be due to the destruction of NE and not dopaminergic terminals. The rats, which were hyperthermic after the destruction of CA fibers in the POA, preferred a lower ambient temperature. Though they were unable to have normal amount of sleep after lesion, it did not affect their behavioral thermoregulation. Acute total sleep deprivation for 48 h led to a significant decrease in noradrenaline, increase in the level of metabolites of monoamines, and an enhancement in the number of dendritic spines at the medial preoptic area (mPOA). Enhanced sleep pressure during sleep deprivation could have led to a higher release of noradrenaline, and an increase in dendritic spines in the mPOA. Arousal was produced by application of noradrenaline at the mPOA, whereas the alpha antagonists produced sleep in free-moving rats. This was in contrast to the increased wakefulness produced by the destruction of NE terminals. As wakefulness and sleep, respectively, were induced on local application of alpha-2 antagonist and agonists, it was suspected that the noradrenaline and alpha antagonists might have acted on the alpha-2 receptors, which are predominantly present on the pre-synaptic terminals. Sleep produced by noradrenaline, which was locally applied at the mPOA, after destroying the NE terminals, further confirmed this possibility. Hypothermia and sexual arousal produced by application of alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonists at the mPOA would have contributed towards the wakefulness induced by these drugs in normal rats. Thus, the available evidence shows that the NE fibers in the POA are involved in the induction of sleep.",

Recent experimental reports have analyzed neurotransmitter signaling before the onset of synaptogenesis, which could act to influence early developmental events such as proliferation, migration, and differentiation of animal brain development. Such signaling may also occur in human development. The expression of molecules involved in neurotransmission in precocious human brain may reflect either the differentiation of a permanent neurotransmitter system of the adult brain or transient expression to serve specific developmental functions different from those in the adult brain. We review the changes observed in the expression of various catecholamine markers such as tyrosine-hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity in various neuronal populations of the developing human telencephalon. The specific transporter for serotonin, serotonin transporter (SERT) has been detected in fibers of the internal capsule (IC) during the restricted time period of 1214 gestational weeks in humans. These serotonin-containing fibers do not correspond to serotoninergic ascending axons from the raphe nuclei. They may be the human counterpart of the thalamo-cortical axons that have been shown to uptake serotonin during the critical period of development of the sensory systems in rodents. GABA phenotypes are expressed in numerous cells of the human ganglionic eminence (GE) and cerebral wall at the end of the embryonic period proper. These results are similar to that described at comparable developmental stages in the mouse and support the hypothesis of an early migration from ganglionic progenitors in humans. But one cannot exclude a transient expression of GABA within the post-mitotic neurons, which could influence early developmental events. In conclusion, data showing the phenotypic expression of molecules in discrete areas of the brain at various points in the protracted human development require careful interpretation.",

The results of this study show that 6-hydroxymelatonin significantly reduces KCN-induced superoxide anion generation, which is accompanied by a commensurate reduction in lipid peroxidation. Partial reversal of the KCN-induced reduction in mitochondrial electron transport is accompanied by a similar reversal of mitochondrial LDH activity blunted by KCN.

In the present study, we used immunocytochemical methods to elucidate the regional, cellular and subcellular distribution of the voltage-gated potassium channel subunit Kv1.4, a member of the Shaker subfamily, in the brain. At the light microscopic level, the Kv1.4 subunit showed a unique distribution pattern, being localized in specific neuronal populations of the rat brain. The neuronal regions expressing the highest levels of Kv1.4 protein included the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus, the posterolateral and posteromedial ventral thalamic nuclei, the dorsolateral and medial geniculate nuclei, the substantia nigra and the dorsal cochlear nucleus. The Kv1.4 subunit was also present in other neuronal populations, with different levels of Kv1.4 immunoreactivity. In all immunolabeled regions, the Kv1.4 subunit was mostly diffusely distributed and, to a lesser extent, it stained cell bodies and proximal dendrites. Furthermore, Kv1.4 immunoreactivity was also detected in nerve terminals and axonal terminal fields. At the electron microscopic level, Kv1.4 was located postsynaptically in dendritic spines and shafts at extrasynaptic sites, as well as presynaptically in axon and active zone of axon terminals, in the neocortex and hippocampus. The findings indicate that Kv1.4 channels are widely distributed in the rat brain and suggest that activation of this channel would have different modulatory effects on neuronal excitability.",

Therefore, we examined the distribution of dopamine (DA)- and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive cells and fibers in the spinal cord of the adult pigeon by immunohistochemistry. TH-immunoreactive cells were located within two restricted areas. One group of cells with multipolar shape was located in laminae VI and VII, close to the whitegray border. These cells were more frequently found at rostral and caudal levels while being scarce at cervical-thoracic levels. The second group of cells was located in lamina VIII surrounding the central canal. These cells were bipolar in shape and were found ventrally and laterally to the central canal, with most of them contacting the lumen of the canal through a separate process. The TH-immunoreactive fibers were distributed in both the gray and the white matter. In the gray matter, they were mainly distributed around the central canal (lamina VIII), in the ventral horn close to the border of laminae VIIIX and in the lateral part of the dorsal horn in laminae IIVI. In the white matter the fibers were present in the lateral columns running longitudinal to the main axis. DA-immunoreactive cells were also located within two restricted areas, closely matching the distribution of TH-immunopositive ones. Additionally, the DA-immunoreactive cells had the same shape as the TH-immunoreactive cells, as bipolar neurons contacted the central canal and multipolar ones were located in the laminae VI and VII. Also the distribution of DA- and TH-immunoreactive fibers roughly matched. Both, DA-immunoreactive cells and fibers were scarcer than TH-immunoreactive ones. This finding suggests that the catecholaminergic system in the spinal cord consists of DA-immunoreactive cells as well as other catecholaminergic cells.",

Here we present data from a horizontal cell type located in the retinorecipient layer 5b of the chick optic tectum. Intracellular labeling revealed that these neurons are multipolar, have no axonal structures and arborize completely within the layer 5b where they extend over considerable distances. Immunohistochemistry with an antibody against calbindin labeled a population of horizontal cells in layer 5b; however, double labeling showed that these neurons represent a subpopulation of approximately one third of the neurons in that layer. Whole-cell patch recordings with additional cell filling from horizontal cells revealed that the physiological responses to depolarization changes with maturation, from a comparatively slow oscillatory pattern reminiscent of hair cell physiology at embryonal stages to a damped series of small action potentials at posthatching. In response to electrical stimulation in the vicinity of the neurons, cells responded with either excitatory postsynaptic potentials or small action potentials. Horizontal cell types are found in the visual midbrain of both avian and mammalian species. On the basis of the data presented here and data from the literature, the functional role of these cells is discussed. As in layer 5b of the chick optic tectum specific synaptic glomeruli have been found, the horizontal cells might constitute local inhibitory circuits within the retino-tectal synapses and, in addition, contribute to mechanisms of directional selectivity in these projections.",

We established a protocol for long-term expansion and dopaminergic differentiation of rodent and human mesencephalic neural progenitor cells. Here we perform functional studies using both biochemical and electrophysiological techniques on dopaminergic neurons derived from rodent mesencephalic progenitor cells labeled with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene promotor-driven expression of enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP). Thus, we demonstrate that these cells produce and release dopamine, express voltage-gated potassium and sodium currents, and fire action potentials. Furthermore, we detect a slowly activating hyperpolarization-activated inward cation current ( I h ), which is specific for dopaminergic neurons among present midbrain neurons. Our results demonstrate that differentiated mesencephalic progenitors exhibit some major morphological and functional characteristics of dopaminergic neurons.

By means of an NPFF antiserum we have investigated the distribution pattern of NPFF-like immunoreactive cells and fibers in the brain of anuran and urodele amphibians. In both amphibian orders, the most conspicuous labeled cell population was found in the preoptic area and hypothalamus, primarily in the suprachiasmatic region. Numerous fibers reached the median eminence and the intermediate lobe of the hypophysis. Only in the anuran brain cells were observed in the pallium and septum. In the urodele, cells and fibers of the terminal nerve were distinctly labeled. Cell bodies were widely distributed in the reticular formation of anurans and, in both orders, a large cell population was found in the nucleus of the solitary tract and the spinal cord. Comparable fiber distribution between both orders exists in which the basal telencephalon (mainly the amygdaloid complex), the hypothalamus and the spinal cord are the regions most richly innervated. The distribution pattern of NPFF-like immunorective elements in the brain of amphibians, which only partly overlaps with those of other FaRPs, supports the notion that a NPFF-like peptide exists in amphibians. On the basis of its localization, this peptide may act as a hypophysiotropic neurohormone and be involved in background adaptation. Its wide distribution in similar zones of the brain in amphibians and mammals suggests that functional roles of this peptide have been conserved in vertebrate evolution.",

This requires not only the execution of motor plans, but also the behaviors that lead to this execution, including emotions and motivation that drive behaviors, cognition that organizes and plans the general strategy, motor planning, and finally, the execution of that plan. The components of the frontal cortex that mediate these behaviors, are reflected in the organization, physiology, and connections between areas of frontal cortex and in their projections through basal ganglia circuits. This comprises a series of parallel pathways. However, this model does not address how information flows between circuits thereby developing new learned behaviors (or actions) from a combination of inputs from emotional, cognitive, and motor cortical areas. Recent anatomical evidence from primates demonstrates that the neuro-networks within basal ganglia pathways are in a position to move information across functional circuits. Two networks are: the striato-nigral-striatal network and the thalamo-cortical-thalamic network. Within each of these sets of connected structures, there are both reciprocal connections linking up regions associated with similar functions and non-reciprocal connections linking up regions that are associated with different cortical basal ganglia circuits. Each component of information (from limbic to motor outcome) sends both feedback connection, and also a feedforward connection, allowing the transfer of information. Information is channeled from limbic, to cognitive, to motor circuits. Action decision-making processes are thus influenced by motivation and cognitive inputs, allowing the animal to respond appropriate to environmental cues.",

Isoproterenol caused a stimulation of c-AMP dependent protein kinase activity in the cells only at the initial stages (45 min) and at 12 and 24 h, there was a decline in the level of phospho-tyrosinated proteins which could be antagonised by the protein kinase A inhibitor, H89. Genestein, a protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, had no effect on the alteration in the morphology of the astroglial cells induced by isoproterenol but by itself, decreased the dephosphorylation of the phospho-tyrosinated proteins, the decline being less than that observed in isoproterenol treated cells. Moreover, unlike H89, genestein had no effect on isoproterenol-induced dephosphorylation of phospho-tyrosinated proteins.

This decrease indicates that the expression of CRP40 is dependant on the neuron's normal physiological state and that it plays an important function in physiological and pathological conditions in the retina.",

Immature female Merino sheep ( n =12) were infused of Ringer solution (control) or 50 g of NPY to the third ventricle for 5 min and then slaughtered 3 h later. Immunoreactive luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) cells were localised by immunohistochemistry using antibody raised against LH and FSH. Messenger RNA analyses were performed by in situ hybridisation using sense and antisense riboprobes produced from  subunits of LH and FSH cDNA clones. The results were generated by computer image analysis to determine the area fraction occupied by immunoreactive and/or hybridising cells and optical density for immunostaining and hybridisation signal. LH in the blood plasma was determined by radioimmunoassay. It was found, that in the lambs infused with NPY the area fraction and optical density for immunoreactive LH cells and mRNA LH-expressing cells increased significantly ( P <0.001), compared to the vehicle-infused animals. The concentration of LH in the blood plasma did not differ between control and treated groups. The NPY infusions had no effect on the immunoreactivity of FSH cells or on expression of mRNA for FSH. In conclusion we suggest that NPY may be an important component of mechanisms stimulating the synthesis and storage but not the release of LH in the pituitary gonadotrophs from prepubertal female sheep. In addition, this effect is specific for LH, no such effect was apparent on FSH.",

An endocannabinoid system is well developed also in the amphibian brain. However, the anatomical substrates of pain modulation have been scarcely investigated in anamniotes, neither is there reference to such a role for cannabinoids in lower vertebrates. In the present paper we employed multiple cytochemical approaches to study the distribution of CB1 cannabinoid receptors and their morphofunctional relationships with some nociception markers (i.e. Substance P, nitric oxide synthase, GABA and  opioid receptors) in the spinal cord of the anuran amphibian Xenopus laevis . We found a co-distribution of CB1 receptors with the aforementioned signaling molecules, as well as a more limited cellular co-localization, in the dorsal and central fields of the spinal cord. These regions correspond to the mammalian laminae IIV and X, respectively, areas strongly involved in spinal analgesia. Comparison of these results with those previously obtained in the mammalian spinal cord, reveals a number of similarities between the two systems and suggests that cannabinoids might participate in the control of pain sensitivity also in the amphibian spinal cord.",

Likewise, we found that almost all nNOS-containing neurons in the NTS contain GluR1, the calcium permeable AMPA receptor subunit. These data suggest that AMPA and NMDA receptors may colocalize in NTS neurons that contain nNOS. However, other investigators have suggested that non-NMDA receptors are located primarily on second-order neurons and NMDA receptors are located predominantly on higher-order neurons in NTS. We now seek to test the hypothesis that NMDA receptors, AMPA receptors and nNOS are colocalized in NTS cells. We performed triple fluorescent immunohistochemical staining of nNOS, NMDAR1 and GluR1, and performed confocal laser scanning microscopic analysis of the NTS. The distributions of nNOS immunoreactivity (IR), NMDAR1-IR and GluR1-IR in the NTS were similar to those we reported earlier. Superimposed images revealed that almost all NMDAR1-IR cells contained GluR1-IR and almost all GluR1-IR cells contained NMDAR1-IR. Some double-labeled cells were additionally labeled for nNOS-IR. All nNOS-IR neurons contained both GluR1-IR and NMDAR1-IR. These studies support our hypothesis that NMDA and AMPA receptors are colocalized in NTS neurons and are consistent with a role of both types of ionotropic receptors in transmission of afferent signals in NTS. In addition, these data provide support for an anatomical link between ionotropic glutamate receptors and nitric oxide in the NTS.",

Repeated MRI of MJP's brain performed during a 4-month follow-up period showed decrease in hematoma size (2.31.51) with evidence for development of encephalomalacia and resorption of blood products involving the area of hemorrhage. MJP had mild transcortical sensory aphasia characterized by difficulty with reading and processing, with semantic paraphasic errors while speaking and some difficulty with repetition. MJP had remained normotensive and seizure free, on Vasotec therapy and Dilantin prophylaxis.

The Beck Anxiety and Depression Inventory revealed minimal anxiety and mild to moderate levels of depression.

Here we investigated whether such terminals also contain somatostatin (SOM), a neuropeptide found in axons distributed throughout the NTS and in somata in the CeA, and known to modulate cardiovascular reflexes when microinjected into the NTS. With fluorescence microscopy, SOM immunoreactivity was seen in the varicosities of some axons throughout the NTS that were anterogradely labelled with biotin dextran amine injected into the CeA. Such varicosities were frequently observed in close proximity to dendrites of NTS neurones that were immunoreactive for the SOM receptor sst 2A subtype, and in many cases also for catecholamine synthesising enzymes. In the caudal, cardioregulatory zone of NTS, SOM immunoreactivity was localised by electron microscopic pre-embedding gold labelling to boutons containing dense-cored and clear pleomorphic vesicles and forming symmetrical synapses, mostly onto dendrites. Additional post-embedding gold labelling for GABA suggested that a subpopulation (29%) of GABAergic terminals sampled in this area of NTS contained SOM. Almost all boutons anterogradely labelled from the amygdala were GABA-immunoreactive (-IR) and 21% of these were SOM-IR. A similar proportion of these boutons (22%) formed synapses onto dendrites containing immunoreactivity for the SOM receptor sst 2A subtype. These observations provide evidence that some of the GABAergic projection neurones in the CeA that inhibit baroreceptor reflex responses in the NTS in response to fear or emotional stimuli could release SOM, which might modulate the activity of NTS neurones via an action on sst 2A receptors.",

In the thoracolumbar spinal cord, neurons in the intermediolateral cell column (IML) and other sympathetic autonomic nuclei were CART peptide-positive; some of these were contacted by immunoreactive fibers arising from the lateral funiculus. By immuno-electron microscopy, axon terminals containing closely packed agranular CART peptide-immunoreactive vesicles appeared to make synaptic contacts with immunoreactive dendrites and soma in the IML, albeit the incidence of such contacts was low. Microinjection of the retrograde tracer Fluorogold into the lateral horn area of the T1T3 spinal segments labeled a population of neurons in the C1 area, many of which were also CART peptide-positive. The results indicate that CART peptide-immunoreactivity is expressed in C1 adrenergic neurons, some of which project to the thoracolumbar spinal cord.

The distribution of HCRT-like immunoreactive (HCRT+) cells and fibers has been described in nocturnal but not diurnal rodents. We therefore examined the anatomical distribution of HCRT+ cells and fibers in the diurnal murid rodent Arvicanthis niloticus (unstriped Nile grass rat).

The densest staining for HCRT+ neuronal fibers was seen in the paraventricular thalamic nucleus, the locus coeruleus, and the raphe nuclei. The distribution of HCRT+ cells and fibers is consistent with that found in other rodents such as rats and Syrian hamsters.

In the glomerular layer, VIP-containing periglomerular cells constituted a population of non-GABAergic neurons and did not receive synapses from olfactory axons. In the EPL, VIP-immunoreactivity appeared in a morphologically heterogeneous population of GABAergic interneurons, most of them identified as satellite cells and Van Gehuchten cells. These interneurons exerted an abundant and selective innervation of the somata, primary and secondary dendrites of the principal mitral and tufted cells, but did not contact granule cells. Perisomatic innervation of the principal cells followed two different patterns. The first included normal basket-like arrangements of VIP-containing varicosities surrounding the somata of mitral and tufted cells. In the second, a set of satellite cells gave rise to short dendritic shafts that embraced the somata of principal cells in an exuberant basket-like arrangement. These two morphological patterns of perisomatic innervation of principal cells were correlated with a neurochemical specificity of the target. In this sense, the exuberant basket-like structures were always found surrounding a subpopulation of principal cells that did not contain the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin (PV). By contrast, they were never found surrounding the subpopulation of PV-containing principal cells, which only showed normal basket-like structures.

Two different anti -GDNF polyclonal antibodies were used. Western blot analysis on homogenates of human and rat brain and recombinant human GDNF resulted in differential detection of monomeric and dimeric forms of the proteins. The ABC immunohistochemical technique on cryostat tissue sections showed an uneven distribution of GDNF-like immunoreactive nerve fibers and terminals and neuronal cell bodies. Immunoreactive elements were mainly localized to the spinal trigeminal, cuneate, solitary, vestibular, and cochlear sensory nuclei, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve, ventral grey column, hypoglossal nucleus, dorsal and ventrolateral medullary reticular formation, pontine subventricular grey and locus coeruleus, lateral regions of the rostral pontine tegmentum, tectal plate, trochlear nucleus, dorsal and median raphe nuclei, caudal and rostral linear nuclei, cuneiform nucleus, and substantia nigra. Comparison between pre- and full-term newborns and adult subjects revealed changes with age in density of positive innervation and frequency of immunoreactive perikarya. The results obtained provide detailed information on the occurrence of GDNF-like immunoreactive neurons in the human brain stem and suggest that the protein is present in a variety of neuronal systems, which subserve different functional activities, at developmental ages and in adult brains.",

Neurofilament-labelled neurons were principally localised to two or three cell layers in most cortical regions, but dramatically reduced labelling was present in areas such as the perirhinal cortex, anterior cingulate and a strip of cortex extending from caudal motor regions through the medial parietal region to secondary visual areas. However, quantitative analysis demonstrated a similar proportion (1020%) of cells with neurofilament triplet labelling in regions of high or low labelling. Combining retrograde tracing with immunolabelling showed that cellular content of the neurofilament proteins was not correlated with the length of projection. Double labelling immunohistochemistry demonstrated that neurofilament content in axons was closely associated with myelination. Analysis of SMI32 labelling in development indicated that content of this epitope within cell bodies was associated with relatively late maturation, between postnatal days 14 and 21. This study is further evidence of a cell type-specific regulation of neurofilament proteins within neocortical neurons. Neurofilament triplet content may be more closely related to the degree of myelination, rather than the absolute length, of the projecting axon.",

Using multiple immunofluorescence of the calcium-binding proteins parvalbumin and calbindin, the GABA A receptor 1-subunit, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), met 5 -enkephalin (MENK) and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), it was shown that VIP-immunostained axons, which are typical for major parts of the extended amygdala, densely innervate only the medial part of IPAC, while they are absent in the lateral part. On the other hand, large-sized GABAergic, parvalbumin- and GABA A receptor 1-subunit-immunoreactive neurons, which are densely covered by separate GAD- and MENK-immuno reactive terminals and a type of medium-sized 1-subunit-monolabelled cells, occur in the dorsal striatum and in the adjacent lateral part of IPAC as well. Large-sized neurons double labelled for parvalbumin and the GABA A receptor 1-subunit are also widely distributed in the neighbouring ventral pallidum. Neurons of this type are absent, however, in the medial part of IPAC and other extended amygdala subunits. Our findings confirm the recent suggestion of a morphofunctional dichotomy of IPAC (Comp. Neurol. 439 (2001) 104), as only the medial part reveals characteristics as typical for extended amygdala, while its lateral part exhibits cytochemical peculiarities of striatal tissue.

Inducible transcription factors have been proposed as one major link in the cascade from modified input to altered neuronal structure and function. We investigated the spatial and temporal patterns of transcription factor induction in the rat whisker-to-barrel pathway by placing the animals in a novel, enriched environment while having clipped sets of whiskers on one side of the face. Such stimulation resulted not only in a specific c-Fos induction in brainstem barrelettes and thalamic barreloids, but also in the barrel-related cortical columns, each with different time courses. In the barrel cortex, c-Fos and Krox-24 immunostaining showed a rapid induction with peak levels at 1 h and a return to basal levels after 14 h. JunB was induced after 1 h of exploration, declined at 6 h and returned to basal levels after this time point. The inducible cyclic AMP early repressor (ICER), a transcription factor of the cAMP signaling pathway, showed a maximum after 6 h, decreased slowly, but elevated levels were still detectable after 5 days. Our data demonstrate that upon whisker stimulation by exploration of a novel, enriched environment, (i) subcortical relay stations in the whisker-to-barrel pathway are able to express elevated levels of c-Fos and (ii) in the barrel cortex c-Fos, JunB, Krox-24 and ICER are differentially regulated in the temporal domain.",

It is speculated that damaging reactive species resulting from the metabolism of dopamine, nitric oxide, and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH 4 ) may be involved. GTP cyclohydrolase I (GCH1) is the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of BH 4 , an essential cofactor for tyrosine hydroxylase and nitric oxide synthase in dopamine and nitric oxide production, respectively. Our studies have explored BH 4 metabolism in the nigrostriatal system following intrastriatal kainic acid lesion. We have demonstrated that 1 week following kainic acid there was an increase in striatal GCH1 mRNA, protein, and activity. There was also an elevation of BH 4 levels in the striatum. Part of the induction of GCH1 was localized in situ to astrocytes. Further, the striatal lesion caused death of both neurons and astrocytes in striatum, as shown by in situ end labeling. These novel observations suggest that the induction of GTP cyclohydrolase and BH 4 in striatal astrocytes may be mediating death of striatal neuronal and non-neuronal cells. This work supports existing and emerging reports that demonstrate the importance of dopamine metabolism in neuronal death of the nigrostriatal system.",

Specifically, we analyzed immediate changes in neuronal activity, identified neurons affected by different stimulation paradigms, and determined the time course over which neuronal activity is altered. In the present study, we used either systemic (harmaline) or electrical stimulation of the inferior cerebellar peduncle (10 and 40 Hz) to alter the firing rate of climbing and mossy fiber afferents to the rat cerebellum and an antibody made against the proto-oncogene, c-fos, as a marker to identify activated neurons and glia. In control animals, only a few scattered granule cells express nuclear Fos-like immunoreactivity. Although no other cells show Fos-like immunoreactivity in their nuclei, Purkinje cells express Fos-like immunoreactivity within their somatic and dendritic cytoplasm in control animals. Within 15 min of chemical or electrical stimulation, numerous granule and glial cells express Fos-like immunoreactivity in their nuclei. Cells in the molecular layer express Fos-like immunoreactivity following harmaline stimulation in a time and lobule specific manner; they do not appear to be activated in the electrical stimulation paradigm. Following harmaline injections, there is an initial loss of Fos-like immunoreactivity in the cytoplasm of Purkinje cells; 90 min later, nuclear staining is observed in a few scattered Purkinje cells. Following electrical stimulation, the cytoplasmic staining in Purkinje cells is enhanced; it is never present in the nucleus. Data derived from this study reveal cell-specific temporal and spatial patterns of c-Fos activation that is unique to each paradigm.

In all of the intralaminar nuclei, deposits of the protein -amyloid occur for the first time during the final phase of cortical -amyloidosis. Functionally, the cytoskeletal pathology encountered in the intralaminar nuclei may contribute to the memory and affective symptoms, attention deficits, and dysfunctions related to horizontal saccades and smooth pursuits seen in AD patients.

Non-dopaminergic DVVG-immunoreactive neurons did not differ significantly in the two strains.

We have evaluated the functional interaction between the D1 and D2 DA receptor subtypes at the cellular and behavioral levels.

Deletion of the DA D1 receptor increased the responsiveness of enkephalin neurons to haloperidol, in that haloperidol-induced increases in c-Fos and catalepsy were enhanced in D1 receptor knockout mice.

This topography closely resembles the zonal expression patterns of putative odorant receptor genes and cell surface glycoconjugates in the nose.

The earliest positive neurons were observed in the inferior reticular nucleus (Ri) in the caudal rhombencephalon at embryonic stage 30. At stage 33b, weakly reactive cells appeared in the tegmentum of the mesencephalon and isthmus, in the ventral hypothalamus (VH), and in the proximity of the solitary tract (sol). At initial larval stages (stages 3438), two new groups appeared in the caudal telencephalon (future amygdaloid complex (Am)) and in the middle reticular nucleus (Rm) of the rhombencephalon. During the active larval life (stages 3955c) the nitrergic system developed progressively both in number of cells and fiber tracts. At stages 3942 reactive cells were found in the inner granular layer (igl) of the olfactory bulb, the telencephalic pallium, the pretectal region, the optic tectum (OT) and retina. New populations of nitrergic cells appear during the second half of the larval period (stages 5255).

Northern blot analyses indicated that GSK-3 mRNA is encoded by a 2.5-kb transcript in adult tissues, whereas a 4.1-kb transcript was found in neonatal tissues. The GSK-3 mRNA is encoded by a 1.6-kb transcript in the testis and a 7.6-kb transcript in the brain, and in many other adult tissues, but not neonatal tissues. Western blot analyses demonstrated that GSK-3 protein was mainly expressed in the brain and heart, whereas GSK-3 was highly expressed in the brain, heart, and testis. A non-radioactive in situ hybridization study using specific digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes showed that GSK-3 and -3 mRNAs were found in many brain regions, and were especially abundant in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum.

Neurol. 399 (1998) 492), we now report the distribution and cellular expression of GLUT4 mRNA in the CNS using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and non-radioactive in situ hybridization (ISH). The former technique demonstrated the expression of GLUT4 in the different regions examined while ISH with a specific riboprobe allowed the anatomical localization of GLUT4 mRNA. A strong hybridization signal was detected in the piriform and entorhinal cortices and in the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampal CA1CA3 areas. Numerous moderately labeled cells were additionally observed in the dentate gyrus granular layer, subiculum and most neocortical areas, as well as in different nuclei of the limbic and motor systems. In contrast, positive cell groups were scarce in the hypothalamus. In the hindbrain, a strong expression of GLUT4 mRNA was observed in the large cell bodies of the red nucleus and cerebellar Purkinje cell layer. Moreover, different groups of moderately labeled cells were found in the deep cerebellar and medullary motor nuclei, in various reticular fields and in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. The present results of ISH mostly agree with the immunocytochemical data reported by our group, although the immunoreactive cells were generally less numerous. However, the fact that a high expression of GLUT4 mRNA was observed in cell bodies of the piriform lobe, hippocampus and substantia nigra, whereas the immunoreactivity for GLUT4 was low in these regions, suggests the existence of post-transcriptional regulation of GLUT4 expression which may depend on the physiological conditions of the animals.",

During the subsequent larval development, more perikarya displaying increased immunoreactivity were found along the course of the olfactory nerve. Moreover, labeled cells cross the meninx of the forebrain gathering in the olfactory bulb of larval turbot. Projections from these cells, directed both to the caudal brain and to the retina, develop when the cells become established in the olfactory bulb. The generation of immunoreactive cells in the olfactory organ extends into the metamorphic period, when a pronounced asymmetry affects the turbot morphology. At this time, the topological location of the immunoreactive cells in the TN becomes distorted. This developmental pattern was compared with those found in other teleosts and in other vertebrates. Preabsorption experiments of anti-neuropeptide Y serum with neuropeptide Y and FMRF-amide suggests that immunoreactive material observed in TN cells was not neuropeptide Y, and raises the possibility that other peptides, e.g. FMRF-amide-like peptides, exist in this neural system.",

The only significant differences in NA contents between the two genotypes were increased levels in hypothalamus and mesencephalic dopaminergic regions A9/A10 of dt J / dt J mutants. The dt J / dt J spinal cord showed a similar result, but its NA content remained unchanged when taking into account its reduced volume.

We report here that following injections of a retrograde tracer into the POM of male quail, large populations of retrogradely labeled cells can be identified in the BSTm. The POM also receives afferent projections from magnocellular vasotocinergic nuclei, the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei. Double labeling for vasotocin immunoreactivity of the retrogradely labeled sections failed however to clearly identify magnocellular vasotocin-immunoreactive cells that were retrogradely labeled from POM. In contrast a substantial population of vasotocin-immunoreactive neurons in the BSTm contained tracer retrogradely transported from the POM. These data therefore demonstrate that a significant part of the vasotocinergic innervation of the quail POM originates in the medial part of the BST. An intrinsic innervation could however also contribute to this network.

The development of new antibodies has provided a sensitive tool to analyze the distribution of aromatase immunoreactive (ARO-ir) material at a cellular level of resolution. In the present study we examined, for the first time, the distribution of ARO-ir cells in the brain of a reptile, the red-sided garter snake, at the beginning of the winter dormancy. ARO-ir cells were found at all rostro-caudal levels in the red-sided garter snake brain. Although weakly stained cells were distributed throughout the brain, more intensely immunoreactive cells were primarily concentrated in the preoptic area, anterior hypothalamus, septum and nucleus sphericus. Although androgens are elevated upon emergence from hibernation in the male red-sided garter snake, initiation of courtship behavior appears to be independent of direct androgen control. To date, the only known stimulus found to initiate courtship is a period of low temperature dormancy followed by exposure to warm temperatures. Circumstantial data, however, suggest an indirect role in the activation of male copulatory behavior for estrogenic metabolites of testosterone produced in the brain by aromatization during the winter dormancy. This study provides the first documentation of the distribution of ARO-ir cells in a reptilian species and demonstrates that while the aromatase enzyme occurs in most regions of the brain, the ARO-ir cells that appear to contain the highest concentration of enzyme are clustered in brain areas classically associated with the control of courtship behavior and mating in vertebrates. These data are consistent with the idea that estrogens locally produced in the brain may participate in some way to the activation of sexual behavior in this species also. This notion should now be experimentally tested by analyzing annual changes in aromatase activity and immunoreactivity and assessing the effects of pharmacological blockade of the enzyme activity at different times of the year.",

The main findings can be summarized as follows: (i) the dorsal striatum of rat and other myomorph rodents reveals a small caudate equivalent homotopic to the caudate nucleus (C) of other mammals, and a large putamen (Pu). (ii) Shell and core can be distinguished also in the rostral pole of nucleus accumbens (ACC) with the calretinin/calbindin and neuropeptide Y (NPY) immunostaining.

In the present study, we have determined the effect of extra auditory stimulation, given as a prenatal sound enrichment protocol, on MNH neurons of posthatch day 1 chicks. Patterned species-specific or musical (sitar) sounds were provided in a graded manner from embryonic day 10 through hatching. Thionin and immunohistochemically stained (PV and CaBP) neurons were evaluated by morphometric methods. The thionin-stained MNH neurons of both the auditory stimulated groups showed a significant increase in nuclear area compared to controls. The change in nuclear dimension was greater in the music-stimulated than in the species-specific sounds-stimulated group. These observations indicate a positive influence of prenatal sound stimulation on MNH neurons. The auditory stimulated groups also demonstrated an increase in the proportion of PV- and CaBP-neurons compared to controls, with the species-specific sounds-stimulated group showing a significantly higher percentage of immunostained cells than the music-stimulated group. However, immunostained cells of both the auditory stimulated groups did not show a significant change in size. These cytoplasmic proteins, by acting as intracellular buffers, enable neurons to display high electrical activity without calcium overload. The influx of Ca 2+ ions is essential for long-term potentiation, a phenomenon important for learning and memory.

At embryonic day 12, neurons in the ventral nucleus of the trapezoid body were first to express ChAT. The temporal expression pattern of both ChAT mRNA and immunoreactivity in this periolivary region mimicked motor neurons in the facial and trigeminal motor nuclei.

Neither ChAT-positive periolivary neurons nor shell neurons co-expressed calcitonin gene-related peptide during development or in the adult. Immediately following birth, intrinsic neurons within the lateral superior olive expressed ChAT but not calcitonin gene-related peptide. However, a transient increase in the number of ChAT-positive neurons in the lateral superior olive coincided with the onset of the calcitonin gene-related peptide co-expression within these neurons. We conclude that ChAT expression appears first in periolivary regions containing medial olivocochlear neurons, precedes the expression of calcitonin gene-related peptide in the superior olivary complex, and is co-expressed with calcitonin gene-related peptide within the lateral superior olive containing lateral olivocochlear neurons.

At P20, prenatal cocaine exposure resulted in a significant increase in 1 subunit mRNA in ACC lamina III and a significant reduction in the amounts of the 2 subunit mRNA in ACC lamina II. No differences between cocaine- and saline-treated controls were detected for 2 subunit mRNA levels in ACC. Although the pattern of labeling was altered in cocaine-exposed animals, Nissl sections revealed no differences in lamination, indicating that the changes in GABA A subunit mRNAs could not be attributed to abnormal cytoarchitectonics. In P60 brains, no significant differences were observed between cocaine- and saline-treated material, indicating that the observed differences were transient. Collectively, our data show that prenatal cocaine exposure elicits differential, lamina-specific changes in mRNA levels encoding selected subunits of the GABA A receptor.

Parvocellular and magnocellular AVT- and MST-ir perikarya were present in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) being AVT-ir fibers more abundant than MST-ir. Vasotocinergic perikarya were also found in a dorsolateral aggregation (DLA) far from the PVN. Mesotocinergic perikarya were also present in the recessus infundibular nucleus and ependyma near to paraventricular organ. Nerve fibers emerging from supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei run along the diencephalic floor, internal zone of the median eminence (ME) to end in the neural lobe. Also a dense network of AVT- and MST-ir fibers was present in the external zone of the ME, close to the vessels of the hypophysial portal system. As a rule, all regions having vasotocinergic and mesotocinergic perikarya also showed immunoreactive fibers. Vasotocinergic and mesotocinergic fibers but not perikarya were found in the lamina terminalis (LT). Moreover AVT-ir fibers were present in the nucleus accumbens and MST-ir fibers in the septum. In mesencephalon and rhombencephalon MST-ir fibers were more numerous than AVT-ir fibers. Vasotocinergic and mesotocinergic fibers in extrahypothalamic areas suggest that these peptides could function as neurotransmitters and/or neuromodulators in the snake B. jararaca .",

The distribution of the opioid receptor-like (ORL1) receptor and its endogenous ligand orphanin FQ (OFQ) in the central nervous system of the adult rat has been recently reported, and although diffusely disseminated throughout the brain, this neuropeptide system is particularly expressed within stress and pain circuitry. Little is known concerning the normal expression of the orphanin system during gestation, nor how opiate or stress exposure may influence its development. Using in situ hybridization techniques, the present study was undertaken to determine the normal pattern of expression of ORL1 mRNA in the human and rat brain at various developmental stages. Rat embryos, postnatal rat brains and postmortem human brains were collected, frozen and cut into 15 m coronal sections. In situ hybridization was performed using riboprobes generated from cDNA containing representative human and rat ORL1 and OFQ sequences. Both ORL1 and OFQ mRNA is detected as early as E12 in the cortical plate, basal forebrain, brainstem and spinal cord. Expression for both ORL1 and OFQ is strongest during the early postnatal period, remaining strong in the spinal cord, brainstem, ventral forebrain, and neocortex into the adult. Human ORL1 and OFQ expression is observed at 16 weeks gestation, remaining relatively unchanged up to 36 weeks. The influence of early orphanin expression on maturation of stress and pain circuitry in the developing brain remains unknown.",

Two different anti-GDNF polyclonal antibodies were used. Western blot analysis on homogenates of human and rat brain and recombinant human GDNF resulted in differential detection of monomeric and dimeric forms of the proteins. The ABC immunohistochemical technique on cryostat tissue sections showed an uneven distribution of GDNF-like immunoreactive nerve fibers and terminals and neuronal cell bodies.

We also identified the dorsal midline column, the supraoculomotor cap and the juxta-aqueductal ring. The acetylcholinesterase gave rise to a strong reaction in the outer half of the lateral column, the outer half of the dorsomedial column, the supraoculomotor cap and the ventral half of the juxta-aqueductal ring. This labeling was in part complementary to that of the NADPH diaphorase and allowed the lateral column to be differentiated from the ventrolateral column. However, the inner half of both lateral and ventrolateral columns displayed the same chemical properties including acetylcholinesterase, tyrosine hydroxilase and serotonin. Thus, from the chemical view, these inner halves should be considered as one different region. Finally, the juxta-aqueductal ring was composed of two clearly different halves, i.e. dorsal and ventral. The dorsal half did not show any clear differences from the above columns and was negative for acetylcholinesterase, NADPH diaphorase and tyrosine hydroxilase, while the ventral half was clearly different from the lateral and ventrolateral columns and displayed a positive reaction to all those chemical markers.

Studies of the pathological changes that characterize AD, together with several other lines of evidence, indicate that A beta accumulation in vivo may initiate and/or contribute to the process of neurodegeneration observed in the AD brain. However, the underlying mechanisms by which A beta peptide influences/causes degeneration of the basal forebrain cholinergic neurones in AD brains remain obscure. We reported earlier that nM concentrations of A beta -related peptides, under acute conditions, can potently inhibit K super(+)-evoked endogenous acetylcholine (ACh) release from the hippocampus and the cortex but not from striatum in young adult rats (J. Neurosci. 16 (1996) 1034). In the present study, to determine whether the effects of A beta peptides alter with normal aging and/or cognitive state, we have measured A beta sub(1-40) levels and the effects of exogenous A beta sub(1-40) on hippocampal ACh release in young adult as well as aged cognitively-unimpaired (AU) and -impaired (AI) rats. Endogenous levels of A beta sub(1-40) in the hippocampus are significantly increased in aged rats. Additionally, 10 nM A beta sub(1-40) potently inhibited endogenous ACh release from the hippocampus of the three groups of rats, but the time-course of the effects clearly indicate that the cholinergic neurones of AI rats are more sensitive to A beta peptides than either AU or young adult rats. These results, together with earlier reports, suggest that the processing of the precursor protein of A beta peptide alters with normal aging and the response of the cholinergic neurones to the peptide possibly varies with the cognitive status of the animals.",

The findings confirmed information documented from single structure examination that the highest expression of both the D1 and D2 mRNAs were localized to the striatum. The cerebral cortex expressed moderate D1 mRNA in all regions with the highest signal in the medial orbital frontal area (Brodmann areas 11, 14), the paraterminal gyrus (Brodmann area 32) and the insular cortex (Brodmann areas 1316), whereas the D2 mRNA expression had very low cortical expression. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and islands of Calleja had high expression of the D1 mRNA and moderate D2 mRNA levels. Moderate to high expression of the D2 mRNA was evident in the hippocampal formation, parafascicular and paraventricular thalamic nuclei, geniculate bodies, subthalamic nucleus, and pineal gland, all of which were devoid of, or showed only faint, D1 mRNA expression. Brainstem regions, e.g. substantia nigra, red nucleus, inferior colliculus, medial lemniscus, and pontine nuclei expressed D2, but not D1, mRNA.

Staining was also dramatically increased in a fiber bundle extending ventrally from Lissauer's tract in lamina I along the lateral edge of the DH to the sacral parasympathetic nucleus in the L6-S1 spinal segments.

The alpha(1B) receptor mRNA was present in most motoneurons (33/39 or 85%). The remaining six adrenoceptor mRNA species investigated were consistently present in micropunches of tissue extracted from the XII nucleus, but were either rarely expressed in individual motoneurons (alpha(1A) mRNA in 15%, alpha(1D) in 14%, alpha(2B/C) in 2% of cells) or absent (alpha(2A), beta(1) and beta(2)). When present, the alpha(1A) and alpha(1D) mRNAs were co-expressed with alpha(1B) mRNA. The adrenoceptor mRNA expression profiles in dissociated locus coeruleus and inferior olive neurons were significantly different.

We performed a unilateral electrical stimulation (7.5 Hz, 5 ms, 0.81.4 mA for 5 min) of the TG in rat, to induce a neurogenic inflammation in the peripheral trigeminal domain including the dura, looking for calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP), substance P (SP) and neurokinin A (NKA) immunoreactivity (IR) in the caudal trigeminal nucleus (CTN) into which massive central trigeminal processes terminate. Here, we show patchy depletion(s) of CGRP-, SP- and NKA-IRs in the contralateral CTN of the rat in addition to their ipsilateral depletion. Such depletion is due to the release of these neuropeptides in the CTN leading to the activation of bilateral trigeminal nociceptive pathway. These data afford the possibility that under specific frequencies (which may roughly correlate to the intensity of the painful stimulus) and/or specific intensities (may correlate to specific areas of the peripheral trigeminal domain) of stimulation, activation of one side of the TG may activate bilateral trigeminal nociceptive pathway leading to the perception of an ill localized/generalized pain or headache rather than a unilateral one.",

In this paper we review the application of visualization procedures to the fine localization, pattern of appearance and functional relevance of monoaminergic receptors in postmortem human brain samples corresponding to different stages of development (fetal, neonatal, infant). Data obtained by using mostly in vitro autoradiography but also in situ hybridization and, very recently, second messenger labeling, are discussed, including the methodological limitations inherent in working with inmature human tissue. From these studies, several conclusions were made. (1) It is possible to visualize, in the human brain with high resolution, the presence of neuroreceptors at early prenatal stages. (2) The anatomical distribution of monoaminergic receptors in the developing human brain is, in general terms, comparable to that found in the adult. (3) During the developmental process, some receptors, which are early and sometimes transiently expressed, play important thophic roles in the regulation of neuronal development: this is the case with the serotonin 5-HT 1A receptors, which attain peak levels of hyperexpression over the hippocampus (dentate gyrus, dendritic areas of CA fields) and the raphe nuclei and show a transient expression in the cerebellum, around the 25 week of gestational age. (4) Different patterns of ontogenetic appearance for human receptors have been identified: dopamine D 2 -like (caudate, putamen, nigra) and 5-HT 1A receptors are good examples of prenatal development, while 5-HT 1B sites (basal ganglia, neocortex) present a mainly postnatal pattern of appearance. (5) Neurotransmitter receptors at human fetal stages are already functional from the point of view of transducing response.",

By using Reelin-immunohistochemistry in different vertebrates (fish, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals: insectivores, odontocetes, rodents, carnivores and man) we show here that Reelin is also expressed by a variety of neurons in the adult pallium. In the everted telencephalon of the zebrafish, Reelin-positive neurons are widely distributed over the dorsal pallium. In land vertebrates, the most consistent and evolutionary conserved location of Reelin-expressing neurons is in the cell-sparse molecular layer associated with laminated cortical organization. We describe an additional heterogeneous population of Reelin-positive neurons outside the molecular layer, the location and distribution of which are more variable, and which may reflect major evolutionary changes in cortical architecture. In squamate reptiles, the Reelin-negative main cell layer is flanked by a superficial and a deep plexiform layer which both contain Reelin-expressing neurons. In mammals, Reelin-positive interneurons are dispersed throughout layers IIVI; the human neocortex is particularly poor in Reelin-positive interneurons. Reelin is also expressed by large stellate and modified pyramidal neurons in layer II of the mammalian entorhinal cortex, and in the superficial lateral cortex of lizards. Examination of this cell population (layer II Pre-) in human brains of different age groups points to a decrease in Reelin-expression in the course of adult life.",

Recently, we reported for the first time that the parasympathetic innervation of the cat LG was also provided by the otic ganglion (OG) and ciliary ganglion (CG), and that the sensory innervation was also provided by the superior vagal ganglion (SVG) and superior glossopharyngeal ganglion (SGG). To determine if nitric oxide (NO) is a neurotransmitter of the autonomic and sensory neurons innervating the LG, we injected the cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) as a retrograde tracer into the cat LG, and used double-labeling fluorescent immunohistochemistry for CTB and nitric oxide synthase (NOS). We found that NOS-/CTB-immunofluorescent double-labeled perikarya were localized in the PPG, OG, TG, SVG and SGG, but not in the CG and SCG. The highest numbers of NOS-/CTB-immunofluorescent double-labeled neurons were found in the PPG and TG. In addition, we examined the presence of nitrergic nerve fibers in the LG using NADPH-d histochemistry and found that a large amount of NADPH-d-stained nerve fibers were distributed around the glandular acini and in the walls of glandular ducts and blood vessels. This study provides the first direct evidence showing that NO may act as a neurotransmitter or modulator involved in the parasympathetic and sensory regulation of lacrimal secretion and blood circulation, but may not be implicated in the sympathetic control of LG activities, and that nitrergic nerve fibers in the LG arise mainly from parasympathetic postganglionic neurons in the PPG and sensory neurons in the TG. The present results suggest that NO plays an important role in the regulation of LG activities.",

Injections of two retrograde tracers, rhodamine- and fluorescein-labelled latex microspheres into the pontine parabrachial nucleus (PBN) and the ventrolateral medulla resulted in labelling of NPFF neurons in the NTS that contained one (double-labelled) or both (triple-labelled) tracers.

Injections of tracers into the PBN and hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus revealed double- and triple-labelled NPFF neurons, a majority of which were located in a zone between the dorsomedial and ventromedial hypothalamus.

In addition, DA also appears to regulate AA, in vivo presumably by modifying enzyme synthesis. The cellular mechanisms and the anatomical substrate that mediate these controls of AA by DA are poorly understood. Tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive (TH-ir) fibers and punctate structures have been previously observed in close vicinity of aromatase-immunoreactive (ARO-ir) cells in the quail medial preoptic nucleus (POM) and bed nucleus striae terminalis (BST) but these fibers could reflect a noradrenergic innervation. We also do not know whether aromatase cells are dopaminoceptive. The main goal of the present study was therefore to bring more information on the anatomical relationships between aromatase expressing neurons and the dopaminergic system in the quail brain. The visualization by immunocytochemistry of DA and of the D1 receptor associated protein DARPP-32 was used to address these questions. DA-ir fibers were observed in the quail forebrain and overlapped extensively with nuclei that contain high densities of ARO-ir cells such as the POM and BST. This confirms that the previously reported TH-ir innervation of ARO-ir cells is, at least in part, of dopaminergic nature. DARPP-32-immunoreactive cells were found in periventricular position throughout the hypothalamus. DARPP-32-ir cells were also observed in telencephalic and mesencephalic areas (hyperstriatum accessorium, paleostriatum, nucleus intercollicularis, optic tectum). DARPP-32-ir fibers were widespread in tel-, di-, and mes-encephalic areas. The highest densities of immunoreactive fibers were detected in the lobus parolfactorius, paleostriatum augmentatum and substantia nigra/area ventralis of Tsai. In double-labeled sections, appositions between DARPP-32 fibers and ARO-ir cells were present in the dorsolateral POM and BST but DARPP-32 immunoreactivity was not detected in the ARO-ir perikarya (no colocalization). These data confirm the presence of a dopaminoceptive structures within the main cell clusters of ARO-ir cells in the quail brain but provide no evidence that these ARO-ir cells are themselves dopaminoceptive. Because DARPP-32 is not present in all types of cells expressing DA receptors, the presence of DA receptors that would not be associated with DARPP-32 in ARO-ir cells still remains to be investigated",

Accumulating evidence suggests that estrogen might exert its control over lordosis by acting, in part, on neurons that contain enkephalin in the VMN. The expression of the enkephalin precursor gene is robustly stimulated by estrogen and is correlated with the later appearance of lordosis. GABA has also been implicated as an important neurotransmitter for the appearance of lordosis. Because enkephalin is thought to act in several brain areas to modulate the activity of GABAergic neurons, we studied the ultrastructural morphology and relationship between neurons containing these neurochemicals using dual-labeling immunocytochemistry in ovariectornized rats, half of which received estrogen replacement. Immunolabeling for enkephalin was almost always detected within axon terminals (695 axonal profiles sampled), while GABA immunoreactivity was more often localized to cell bodies and dendrites (191 profiles), than to axons (63 profiles). Axon terminals containing enkephalin immunolabeling provided a major innervation to soma or dendrites containing GABA. That is, over one third (94/245) of the axon terminals in contact with GABA-immunoreactive dendrites contained enkephalin. Furthermore, these GABA-immunoreactive dendrites accounted for a fifth of the somatodendritic processes associated with enkephalin-containing axon terminals. These findings support the hypothesis that enkephalin may act in the VMN by inhibiting GABAergic neurons, which could result in the disinhibition of neural circuits relevant for lordosis.",

This study was designed to examine the distribution of hypocretin immunoreactivity in Syrian hamsters, as important differences in neuropeptide distribution between rats and hamsters have previously been demonstrated. Immunoreactive cell bodies were found primarily in the lateral hypothalamic area and the perifornical area, although a few hypocretin-positive cells were also located in the dorsomedial hypothalamus and the retrochiasmatic area. Fibers were distributed throughout the brain in a pattern similar to that seen in rats. The densest projections were found in the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus, locus coeruleus, dorsal raphe, and lateroanterior hypothalamus. The innervation of the anterior hypothalamus may be of particular interest as similar cluster of immunoreactivity does not appear to be present in rats. Moderate levels of immunoreactivity could be seen throughout the hypothalamus, the lateral septum, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, A5 noradrenergic area, and the midline thalamic nuclei. Hypocretin-immunoreactive fibers are present in all lamina of the spinal cord, with the greatest axon densities in lamina 1 and 10. The widespread distribution of hypocretin suggests its involvement in a wide variety of physiological and behavioral processes.

Integrated optical densities (IODs) of immunofluorescence over individual neuromelanin-containing neurons and in areas of neuropil and the number of neurons on H & E stained adjacent sections were quantitated with the use of the BioQuant Image Analyzer. Data were statistically analyzed by ANOVA, including the unpaired two-tailed Student t -test and the MannWhitney test. The results showed 55.8% ( P <0.0001) dropout of SNc neurons in PD brains compared to age-matched controls. Despite considerable neuronal dropout, immunofluorescent NTFs in the PD brains showed differential reductions that were consistent within the group as compared to age-matched controls: reductions were GDNF, 19.4%/neuron ( P <0.0001), 20.2%/neuropil ( P <0.0001); CNTF, 11.1%/neuron ( P <0.0001), 9.4%/neuropil ( P <0.0001); BDNF, 8.6%/neuron ( P <0.0001), 2.5%/neuropil.

Since the depletion of GDNF both within surviving neurons and neuropil was twice as great as that of CNTF and BDNF and since the other NTFs showed no changes, GDNF, of the tested NTFs, is probably the most susceptible and the earliest to decrease in the surviving neurons of SNc.

While the distribution of immunoreactive cells was generally similar in both species, some differences were observed. For example in the hamster LF, a higher percentage of stained neurons was seen than in the IML, while the situation was rather inverse in the rat. In order to study the coincidence of nNOS-LI in the population of preganglionic sympathetic neurons (PSN) that innervate the superior cervical ganglion (SCG), these were identified by retrograde axonal transport of fluoro-gold (FG) following unilateral injection into the SCG. PSN were localized ipsilateral to the injection site mainly in the IML and LF of spinal segments C7Th4. The portion of double-labeled neurons of the IML were lower in hamster (17% in C7, 34% in C8) of FG-labeled cells) than in rat (47% in C8, 77% in Th2), while in the LF of segments C8Th2 in both species the majority of FG-neurons contained nNOS. While only very few double-labeled neurons were detected in the IC in hamster and rat, a striking difference was observed in the CA, where no double-labeled neurons were found in hamster, but up to 50% in rat. Double immunofluorescence detection of nNOS and substance P (SP) showed that in both the autonomic regions and the dorsal horn, SP-LI fibers and puncta were present in close spatial relationship to nNOS-LI cell bodies. These results were basically identical in the hamster and rat. Unilateral transection of the dorsal roots of segments C6Th2 in rats resulted in a clear reduction of SP-LI structures in the dorsal horn 5 days after rhizotomy, but not in the autonomic regions. Compared to the unlesioned side, the numbers of nNOS-LI neurons in the superficial laminae of the dorsal horn were reduced to 3246% in the lesioned segments, and to 53% and 87%, respectively, in the two segments cranial to the rhizotomized segments but remained unchanged caudally to the lesion. Numbers of nNOS-LI cell bodies in the autonomic regions were not altered following dorsal root transection. The present study provides data on the widespread distribution of nNOS in the spinal cord of golden hamster and describes the partial coincidence of the enzyme in PSN. The effects of dorsal rhizotomy on nNOS-LI neurons in the dorsal horn reveal that primary-afferent fibers provide a stimulatory influence on neurons of the dorsal horn to generate the gaseous neuroactive substance, nitric oxide.",

The reaction for parvalbumin showed small and medium-sized neurons in the superficial layers, a predominance of large stellate cells in the stratum griseum intermediale, and medium-sized cells in the deep layers. In the lateral geniculate nucleus of Cebus , parvalbumin is found in the cells of both the P and M pathways, whereas calbindin is mainly found in the interlaminar and S layers, which are part of the third visual pathway. Calretinin was only found in cells located in layer S. This pattern is similar to that observed in Macaca , showing that these calcium-binding proteins reveal different components of the parallel visual pathways both in New and Old World monkeys.",

Soon it will be possible to investigate alterations at the transcript level of the entire human genome. There is great hope that these techniques will at last shed light on the pathological processes involved in complex neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. These scientific advances in turn have re-kindled a great interest and demand for post-mortem brain tissue. Good quality post-mortem tissue undoubtedly is the fundamental prerequisite to investigate complex brain disorders with molecular profiling techniques. In this review we show that post-mortem brain tissue can yield good quality mRNA and intact protein antigens which allow the successful application of traditional molecular biology methods as well as novel profiling techniques. We also consider the use of laser-capture microdissection on post-mortem tissue. This recently developed technique allows the experimenter to explore the molecular basis of cellular function at the single cell level. The combination of laser-capture microdissection with high throughput profiling techniques offers opportunities to obtain precise genetic fingerprints of individual neurons allowing comparisons of normal and pathological states.",

Three days after unilateral injection of KA to the striatum in the rat, a dramatic direct cytotoxic effect was observed, as indicated an expression of Bcl-2 immunoreactivity in TUNEL- and OX-42-positive cells in the KA-injected striatum and traumatized cortical region. A less severe detrimental effect was also observed in the ipsilateral substantia nigra and peritraumatic cortex, as reflected by an upregulation of Bcl-2-immunostained neurons. Surprisingly, a reduction in Bcl-2-immunoreactive neurons that was accompanied by a less severe loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway was observed after co-treatment with melatonin. Western blot analysis confirmed that Bcl-2 expression is elevated in striatum and cortex on the lesioned side, and that its expression was attenuated substantially after systemic administration of melatonin. The results showing an upregulation of Bcl-2 in nigral neurons and reactive microglia after KA lesion are consistent with the view that Bcl-2 is protective in function in the central nervous system.",

In neocortical regions (frontal, parietal and retrosplenial cortex), the strongest 5-HT2A-IR was found in the apical dendrites of pyramidal cells in layers IIIV, while 5-HT-IR terminal-like varicosities were present in all layers but most prominently in the outer layers. In other forebrain regions, the olfactory bulb, the hippocampal formation, and the islands of Calleja and Calleja magna, localized discrepancies were present between the 5-HT2A-IR neuronal profiles and the 5-HT-IR terminal-like varicosities. Hardly any additional juxtapositions between the 5-HT2A-IR neuronal profiles and 5-HT-IR terminal-like varicosities were revealed when the intraneuronal level of 5-HT was increased by monoamine oxidase inhibitor pretreatment (nialamide, 250 mg/kg, 3 h). Thus, in most forebrain regions, there were overall few juxtapositions between 5-HT terminal-like varicosities and 5-HT2A-IR neuronal structures.

That this deficit might be brought about during early foetal or neonatal life is a hypothesis consistent with the substantial indications for a neurodevelopmental aetiology of the disease. GABAergic neurons can be defined by the presence of one of three types of calcium binding proteins, which are thought to have neuroprotective properties. We have undertaken an investigation into the postnatal ontology of these neuronal subtypes and find that calretinin expression is relatively constant and present from before birth, calbindin expression is also present early but redistributes in the cortex over the first months of life, while parvalbumin-immunoreactivity is not observed until between 3 and 6 months of age. Investigation of frontal cortical tissue taken post mortem from a series of schizophrenic patients and matched control subjects revealed that parvalbumin-, but not calretinin-immunoreactive cells are significantly diminished in schizophrenia.

We have analysed the density and distribution of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) that are immunoreactive with the monoclonal antibody (mAb) 423 in a prospectively analysed population of Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases and age-matched controls. NFTs were examined in allocortical and isocortical areas and correlated with Braak pathological stage and clinical severity of dementia. The mAb 423 was used as it recognises a C-terminally truncated tau fragment that is a major constituent of NFTs. Our results show that extracellular NFTs and, to a lesser extent, intracellular NFTs, correlated significantly with both Braak stages and the clinical index of severity. Furthermore, a differential distribution of the two types of tangles indicates that layer II of the entorhinal cortex and the transentorhinal area are particularly vulnerable to neurofibrillary degeneration. These areas serve as a point of connection between isocortex and hippocampus. Our findings, therefore, suggest that the perforant pathway may be substantially affected by the accumulation of truncated tau protein in AD and that this represents a neuropathological predictor for the clinical severity of dementia. When neurofibrillary pathology was examined by combined labelling with mAbs 423 and Alz-50 and the dye thiazin red, we were able to demonstrate various stages of tau aggregation.

Angiotensin IV binding sites (also known as the AT 4 receptors) are widely distributed in guinea pig and monkey ( Macaca fascicularis ) brains where high densities of the binding sites have been detected in the hippocampus, neocortex and motor nuclei. However, the distribution of the binding sites in the human brain is not known. We have recently localised the angiotensin IV binding sites (AT 4 receptors) in post-mortem human brain using iodinated Nle-angiotensin IV, a higher affinity and more stable analogue of angiotensin IV. This radioligand bound with relatively high affinity and specificity to angiotensin IV binding sites. In competition studies on consecutive sections through the prefrontal cortex and claustrum, angiotensin IV, Nle-angiotensin IV and LVV-hemorphin 7 competed for the binding of 125 I[Nle]-angiotensin IV with nanomolar affinities. Angiotensin II and the AT 1 and AT 2 receptor antagonists were ineffective in competing for the binding at concentrations of up to 10 M. We found high densities of 125 I[Nle]-angiotensin IV binding sites throughout the cerebral cortex including the insular, entorhinal, prefrontal and cingulate cortices. Very high densities of the binding sites were observed in the claustrum, choroid plexus, hippocampus and pontine nucleus. Some thalamic nuclei displayed high densities of binding including the anteroprincipal, ventroanterior, anteromedial, medial dorsal and ventrolateral nuclei. The caudate nucleus, putamen, many amygdaloid nuclei and the red nucleus all displayed moderate densities of binding with a higher level detected in the substantia nigra pars compacta. In the hypothalamus, high densities binding sites were found in the ventromedial nucleus with lower levels in the dorsomedial and paraventricular nuclei. The distribution of 125 I[Nle]-angiotensin IV binding sites in the human brain is similar to that found in other species and supports multiple roles for the binding sites in the central nervous system, including facilitation of memory retention and retrieval.",

Because these techniques use physiological responses such as increased perfusion or metabolism as surrogate indicators of evoked neuronal electrical activity, understanding the role of these processes in sustaining the information processing function of neurons is vital to the proper interpretation of functional neuroimaging data. An ultimate goal of these non-invasive techniques is to approach the sensitivity and spatial resolution of earlier autoradiographic methods, which have repeatedly demonstrated exquisitely detailed delineations of neuronal response patterns using metabolic glucose uptake as a physiological tag. Although glucose is generally metabolized in conjunction with oxygen, technical challenges in imaging tissue oxygen consumption in vivo have limited the use of this complementary process in the detection of neuronal activation. In this article we review concepts linking cerebral blood flow and metabolism to neuronal activation, and compare functional imaging techniques that exploit these relationships. We also describe recently introduced MRI based methods for measurement of oxygen consumption and assess the relative contributions of different metabolic pathways during neuronal activation. Our calculations suggest that the bulk of the energy demand evoked during stimulation of neurons in visual cortex is met through oxidative metabolism of glucose, supporting the use of oxygen uptake as a marker for increased neuronal electrical activity.",

However, perilesional nitric oxide synthase-I containing neurons are known to be resistant to ischemic and excitotoxic injury. In vitro studies show that nitrosonium and nitroxyl ions inactivate N -methyl- d -aspartate receptors, resulting in neuroprotection. The question remains of how these cells are protected against their own high intracellular nitric oxide production after activation. In this study, we investigated immunocytochemically nitric oxide synthase-I containing cortical neurons in rats after unilateral, cortical photothrombosis. In this model of focal ischemia, perilesional, constitutively nitric oxide synthase-I containing neurons survived and co-expressed antioxidative enzymes, such as manganese- and copper-zinc-dependent superoxide dismutases, heme oxygenase-2 and cytosolic glutathione peroxidase. This enhanced antioxidant expression was accompanied by a strong perinuclear presence of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein. No colocalization was detectable with upregulated heme oxygenase-1 in glia and the superoxide and prostaglandin G 2 -producing cyclooxygenase-2 in neurons. These results suggest that nitric oxide synthase-I containing interneurons are protected against intracellular oxidative damage and apoptosis by Bcl-2 and several potent antioxidative enzymes. Since nitric oxide synthase-I positive neurons do not express superoxide-producing enzymes such as cyclooxygenase-1, xanthine oxidase and cyclooxygenase-2 in response to injury, this may additionally contribute to their resistance by reducing their internal peroxynitrite, H 2 O 2 -formation and caspase activation.",

Previous double label immunohistochemical studies have shown that both lateral and medial olivocochlear neurones are contacted by noradrenergic nerve endings, and electrophysiological studies on in-vitro rat brain slices have demonstrated that noradrenaline exerts a direct, predominantly excitatory effect on medial olivocochlear neurones. In this paper, we have investigated the origin of the noradrenergic input to the superior olivary complex (SOC). A retrograde tracer, Fluorogold, was used to map the inputs to the SOC, and this was combined with immunofluorescent staining for dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DH) to identify which of the afferent inputs was noradrenergic. These experiments showed small numbers of neurones double-stained for both Fluorogold and DH in the A6 cell group (the locus coeruleus). In the A7 cell group, within and medial to the lateral lemniscus, numerous Fluorogold labelled and DH positive neurones were found, but no neurones were seen that were double-labelled. In none of the other major noradrenergic cell groups were labelled Fluorogold neurones ever detected. To confirm the results obtained by retrograde tracer injections, anterograde tracer injections with biotinylated dextran amine were made in the locus coeruleus. This resulted in labelled fibres within all subdivisions of the superior olivary complex. These experiments indicate that the noradrenergic input to the olivocochlear neurones originates solely from the locus coeruleus. The small numbers of double-labelled neurones found in the locus coeruleus indicate a very divergent non-selective noradrenergic input to the SOC.",

[125I]alpha-Bungarotoxin binding was distributed homogeneously across all cortical layers in all three brain regions, with highest binding densities in the cingulate cortex. [3H]Cytisine and [3H]epibatidine binding varied across the cortical ribbon, with high binding in layers I, III, V and VI, within the three cortical regions. A significantly reduced [125I] alpha-bungarotoxin binding (-54%) was observed in the cingulate cortex of schizophrenia subjects, in comparison with normal individuals who smoked tobacco. In the same brain region also a significantly higher [3H]cytisine binding (48-77%) was observed in nearly all layers, except for layer I of the schizophrenia subjects, when compared to normal individuals with a history of tobacco use. No significant changes in [3H]epibatidine binding was observed within the individual cortical layers between control subjects and patients with schizophrenia, but when calculated as a whole region (i.e. measurements performed across the whole cortical ribbon), the temporal cortex showed a significant increase in [3H]epibatidine binding in schizophrenia subjects compared to control subjects. The results suggest opposite changes of the alpha4beta2 and alpha7 nicotinic receptor subtypes in the cingulate cortex of patients with schizophrenia which might reflect involvement of two different nicotinic receptor mechanisms in schizophrenia brain.",

Studies of the pathological changes that characterize AD, together with several other lines of evidence, indicate that A accumulation in vivo may initiate and/or contribute to the process of neurodegeneration observed in the AD brain. However, the underlying mechanisms by which A peptide influences/causes degeneration of the basal forebrain cholinergic neurones in AD brains remain obscure. We reported earlier that nM concentrations of A-related peptides, under acute conditions, can potently inhibit K + -evoked endogenous acetylcholine (ACh) release from the hippocampus and the cortex but not from striatum in young adult rats (J. Neurosci. 16 (1996) 1034). In the present study, to determine whether the effects of A peptides alter with normal aging and/or cognitive state, we have measured A 140 levels and the effects of exogenous A 140 on hippocampal ACh release in young adult as well as aged cognitively-unimpaired (AU) and -impaired (AI) rats. Endogenous levels of A 140 in the hippocampus are significantly increased in aged rats. Additionally, 10 nM A 140 potently inhibited endogenous ACh release from the hippocampus of the three groups of rats, but the time-course of the effects clearly indicate that the cholinergic neurones of AI rats are more sensitive to A peptides than either AU or young adult rats. These results, together with earlier reports, suggest that the processing of the precursor protein of A peptide alters with normal aging and the response of the cholinergic neurones to the peptide possibly varies with the cognitive status of the animals.",

Using immunoblot methods, we found Parkin isoforms varying from 54 to 58 kDa in rat, mouse, bird, frog and fruit-fly brains. Immunocytochemical studies carried out in rats, mice and birds demonstrated multiple cell types bearing the phenotype for Parkin throughout telencephalic, diencephalic, mesencephalic and metencephalic brain structures. While in some instances Parkin-containing neurons tended to be grouped into clusters, the majority of these labeled nerve cells were widely scattered throughout the neuraxis. The topographical distribution and organizational pattern of Parkin within major functional brain circuits was comparable in both rats and mice. However, the subcellular localization of Parkin was found to vary significantly as a function of antibody reactivity. A consistent cytoplasmic labeling for Parkin was observed in rodent tissue incubated with a polyclonal antibody raised against the human Parkin protein and having an identical amino-acid sequence with that of the rat. In contrast, rodent tissue alternately incubated with a polyclonal antibody raised against a different region of the same human Parkin protein but having 10 mismatched amino-acid sequence changes with those of the rat and mouse, resulted in nuclear labeling for Parkin in rat but not mouse neurons. This difference in epitope recognition, however, was reversed when mouse brain tissue was heated at 80C, apparently unmasking target epitopes against which the antisera were directed. Collectively, these results show a high degree of conservation in the cellular identity of Parkin in animals as different as drosophilids and mammals and points to the possibility that the biochemical specificities of Parkin, including analogous functional roles, may have been conserved during the course of evolution.",

Convergent information indicates that interneurons in the hippocampus and other forebrain structures are decreased in number and function in subjects with schizophrenia. Among the neurochemical markers that are decreased in the hippocampus are synapsin I, cholecystokinin, somatostatin, glutamic acid decarboxylase, and nitric oxide synthase. GABA uptake sites and the GABA synthetic enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase are also diminished. Included among these findings is decreased binding of alpha -bungarotoxin, which binds to low-affinity nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, such as the alpha 7-nicotinic receptor. Co-labeling experiments in rodents indicate that these markers are expressed on overlapping populations of hippocampal interneurons. Thus, the finding of decreased neurochemical function of hippocampal interneurons is a widely replicated finding, with different groups reporting markedly similar findings using independent post mortem samples and different neurochemical strategies. Decreased alpha -bungarotoxin binding or decreased alpha 7-nicotinic receptor immunoreactivity has also been found in the frontal cortex and in the nucleus reticularis thalami of schizophrenic subjects. The alpha 7-nicotinic receptor subunit gene on chromosome 15q14 is a site of heritability for schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder, and in, particular, for a deficit in inhibitory neuronal function associated with these illnesses. Thus, the post mortem data are further supported by psychophysiologic and genetic investigations that indicate a deficit in inhibitory interneuronal function, involving the alpha 7-nicotinic receptor. The alpha 7-receptor is a ligand-gated ion channel that admits calcium ions into cells, and it has been proposed to have various developmental roles. Its malfunction may be part of the developmental pathogenesis of schizophrenia.",

The evaluation of the mean numerical density of neuronal or glial cells does not take into account the topographical heterogeneity and thereby misses the information that it contains. A local measurement of the density can be obtained by evaluating the numerical density of one cell, i.e. the ratio 1/(the volume that the cell occupies). This volume is the region of space that is closer to that cell than to any other. It has the shape of a polyhedron, called Voronoi (or Dirichlet) polyhedron. In 2-D, the Voronoi polyhedron is a polygon, the sides of which are located at mid-distance from the neighbouring cells. The Voronoi polygons are contiguous and their set fills the space without interstice or overlap, i.e. they perform a tessellation that may yield a density map when the same colours are used to fill polygons of similar sizes. The use of Voronoi polygons allows computing the confidence interval of a mean numerical density that makes statistical comparisons possible. The tessellation also provides information concerning spatial distribution; the areas of the Voronoi polygons do not vary much when the cells are regularly distributed. On the contrary, small and large polygons are found when cellular clusters are present. The coefficient of variation of the polygon areas is an objective measurement of their variability and helps to define regular, clustered and random distributions. When cells are clustered, small polygons are contiguous and may be objectively identified by simple algorithms. Voronoi tessellations are easily performed in 2-D. On an average the area of a polygon times the thickness of the section equals the volume of the corresponding polyhedron. 3-D tessellations that are theoretically possible and for which algorithms have been published remain to be adapted to histological works.",

This study examines the distribution and fine structure of kappa opioid receptor-immunoreactive elements in the CA1 subfield and reveals some new aspects concerning the structural basis of opioid-GABA interaction in the rat hippocampal formation. Kappa receptors were visualized immunocytochemically with a previously produced and characterized monoclonal antibody, the mAb KA8 (Maderspach, K., Nemeth, K., Simon, J., Benyhe, S., Szucs, M., Wollemann, M., 1991. A monoclonal antibody recognizing kappa-, but not mu- and delta-opioid receptors. J. Neurochem. 56, 18971904). The antibody selectively recognizes the kappa opioid receptor with preference to the kappa 2 subtype. Neuronal cell bodies, proximal dendrites and occasionally glial processes surrounding neuronal perikarya were labelled in the CA1 area. The immunopositive cells were present mainly in the stratum oriens, followed by the stratum pyramidale in a rostrocaudally increasing number. Their shape was fusiform, or multipolar. Occasionally kappa receptor-immunoreactive boutons surrounding weakly immunopositive somata were also observed. Electron microscopy of immunopositive neurons showed that the DAB labelling was intensive in the perinuclear cytoplasm. The widths and electron densities of the postsynaptic densities of some axosomatic synapses were remarkably increased. Similar increase of postsynaptic densities were observable at some axodendritic and axospinous synapses. On the basis of their location and fine structural properties the labelled cells are suggested to be GABAergic inhibitory interneurons, probably belonging to the somatostatinergic sub-population. The axons of these inhibitory interneurons are known to arborize in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare where the entorhinal afferents terminate. A modulatory effect of opioids on the entorhinal input, mediated by somatostatinergic interneurons is suggested",

Prominent filamentous tau pathology and brain degeneration in the absence of extracellular amyloid deposition characterize a number of other neurodegenerative disorders (i.e. progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, Pick's disease) collectively referred to as tauopathies. The discovery of multiple tau gene mutations that are pathogenic for hereditary frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 in many kindreds, as well as the demonstration that tau polymorphisms are genetic risk factors for sporadic tauopathies, directly implicate tau abnormalities in the onset/progression of neurodegenerative disease. Different tau gene mutations may be pathogenic by impairing the functions of tau or by perturbing the splicing of the tau gene, thereby resulting in biochemically and structurally distinct tau aggregates. However, since specific polymorphisms and mutations in the tau gene lead to diverse phenotypes, it is plausible that additional genetic or epigenetic factors influence the clinical and pathological manifestations of both familial and sporadic tauopathies. Thus, efforts to develop animal models of tau-mediated neurodegeneration should provide further insights into the onset and progression of tauopathies as well as Alzheimer's disease, and they could accelerate research to discover more effective therapies for these disorders.",

Such differences were mainly observed as irregularities in the arborization patterns in the inner part of the inner plexiform layer.

Most thalamic nuclei show immunoreactive cell bodies for at least two of the three calcium-binding proteins; the only nucleus showing immunoreactivity for one calcium-binding protein is the centre median nucleus (CM) which is parvalbumin-positive. Overall, the calcium-binding proteins show a complementary staining pattern in the human thalamus. In general terms, the highest density of parvalbumin staining is in the component nuclei of the ventral nuclear group (i.e. in the ventral anterior, ventral lateral and ventral posterior nuclear complexes) and in the medial and lateral geniculate nuclear groups. Moderate densities of parvalbumin staining are also present in regions of the mediodorsal nucleus (MD). By contrast, calbindin and calretinin immunoreactivity both show a similar distribution of dense staining in the thalamus which appears to complement the pattern of intense parvalbumin staining. That is, calbindin and calretinin staining is most dense in the rostral intralaminar nuclear group and in the patchy regions of the MD which show very low levels of parvalbumin staining. However, calbindin and calretinin also show low levels of staining in the ventral nuclear complex and in the medial and lateral geniculate bodies which overlaps with the intense parvalbumin staining in these regions.

In the present study the expression pattern of gp130 in the developing and adult mouse cerebellum was investigated. At embryonic day (E)15 and E17, gp130 immunoreactivity is present primarily in fiber bundles that course from the brainstem to the cerebellum. At postnatal day (P)0, gp130 immunoreactivity first appears in the Purkinje cell layer, external granule cell layer, and cerebellar nuclei.

All Purkinje cells show intense gp130 immunoreactivity in their cell bodies by P7. In contrast the gp130 immunoreactivity detected in fiber bundles at E15 and E17 is downregulated postnatally, and cannot be detected after P7.

Virtual brain regions with various spatial distributions of virtual neurons were modeled. The total numbers of virtual neurons in the modeled brain regions were repeatedly estimated by simulation of modern design-based stereology, either by using the fractionator method or by the established method based on the product of estimated neuron density and estimated volume of the reference space. We show that estimates of total numbers of neurons obtained using the fractionator are from a statistical and economical standpoint more efficient than corresponding estimates obtained using the density/volume procedure. Furthermore, the use of two simple prediction methods (one for homogeneous and the other for clustered neuron distributions) permits satisfactory predictions about the variation of presumably any estimates of total numbers of neurons obtained using the fractionator. Finally, we show that assessing the reliability of estimates of mean total neuronal numbers using the ratio between the mean of the squared coefficients of error of the estimates and the squared coefficient of variation of the estimated total neuronal numbers, a frequently employed method in stereological studies, is neither useful nor informative. The present results may constitute a new set of recommendations for the rigorous usage of design-based stereology.

However, in contrast to ALS, this process occurs in the experimental paradigm in the absence of a glial response. In addition, whereas ALS is a fatal disorder, the cessation of aluminum exposure leads to both clinical and neuropathological recovery. Because microglia can influence neuronal regeneration, we have examined the effect of both acute and chronic aluminum exposure on microglial activation in vivo. We have studied microglial morphology in young adult New Zealand white rabbits receiving either single (1000 g) or repeated sublethal (100 g monthly) intracisternal inoculums of AlCl 3 . In addition, rabbits receiving 1000 g AlCl 3 inoculums were studied following an unilateral sciatic axotomy 48 h prior to the AlCl 3 exposure. Our studies demonstrate that microglial activation in vivo is inhibited by AlCl 3 exposure, and that a correlation exists between the extent of microglia suppression and the potential for recovery. This suggests that microglial activation is an important determinant of neuronal injury.",

Using tract-tracing methods with a specific retrograde fluorescent tracer, fluorogold, we examined the cells of origin of afferents to the retrochiasmatic area in sheep. The retrogradely labeled cells were seen by observation of the tracer by direct fluorescence or by immunohistochemistry with specific antibodies raised in rabbits or horses. Among the retrogradely labeled neurons, double immmunohistochemistry for tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine--hydroxylase, and serotonin were used to characterize catecholamine and serotonin FG labeled neurons. The retrochiasmatic area, which included the A15 dopaminergic group and the accessory supraoptic nucleus (SON), received major inputs from the lateral septum (LS), the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), the thalamic paraventricular nucleus, hypothalamic paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei, the perimamillary area, the amygdala, the ventral part of the hippocampus and the parabrachial nucleus (PBN). Further, numerous scattered retrogradely labeled neurons were observed in the preoptic area, the ventromedial part of the hypothalamus, the periventricular area, the periaqueductal central gray (CG), the ventrolateral medulla and the dorsal vagal complex. Most of the noradrenergic afferents came from the ventro-lateral medulla (A1 group), and only a few from the locus coeruleus complex (A6/A7 groups). A few dopaminergic neurons retrogradely labeled with flurogold were observed in the periventricular area of the hypothalamus. Rare serotoninergic fluorogold labeled neurons belonged to the dorsal raphe nucleus. Most of these afferents came from both sides of the brain, except for hypothalamic supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei.

They have often been referred to as a Rosetta stone, as several features first described for serotonin neurons or paraneurons have been then extended to other neurotransmitter systems: coexistence with neuropeptides or even a canonical neurotransmitter (GABA), volume transmission, regrowth after lesioning, and characterization of multiple receptor subtypes. This review deals with the contributions of neuroanatomical approaches for studying serotoninergic systems, and focuses on recent advances concerning the topological relationships between serotonergic innervation, receptors and target cells. This aspect is particularly important with regard to the possibility for serotonin to act through classical synaptic transmission and/or non-junctional transmission. Serotonin then can selectively regulate different neuronal systems through the activation of distinct receptor subtypes, which in turn can be linked to different transduction pathways. Neurocytochemical approaches constitute unique tools to analyse both anatomical and functional characteristics of complex neuronal systems.",

Most of their neurons express nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity.

The intensity of the NADPH-diaphorase staining of neurons of the pedunculopontine nucleus, however, remained unchanged bilaterally.

In contrast, large electrolytic lesions involving other thalamic nuclei or extrapyramidal structures did not change the number of NADPH-diaphorase neurons or their intensity of staining in the laterodorsal tegmental nuclei.

In addition, double labeling in situ hybridization was performed to characterize the NPY neuronal populations in relation to the Y1 and/or Y2 receptor mRNA localization in the human cerebral cortex, striatum, and amygdala. NPY mRNA was found to be abundant in layers II and VI of the neocortex, polymorphic layer of the dentate gyrus, basal ganglia, and amygdala.

We hypothesized that perinatal asphyxia may lead to a neurodegenerative process resulting in cognitive impairment and altered presynaptic bouton numbers in adult rats. We studied cognitive performance at 18 months and presynaptic bouton numbers at 22 months following perinatal asphyxia. Data of the spatial Morris water escape task did not reveal clear memory or learning deficits in aged asphyctic rats compared to aged control rats. However, a memory impairment in aged rats versus young rats was observed, which was more pronounced in asphyctic rats. We found an increase in presynaptic bouton density in the parietal cortex, whereas no changes were found in striatum and frontal cortex in asphyctic rats. An increase of striatal volume was observed in asphyctic rats, leading to an increase in presynaptic bouton numbers in this area. These findings stress the issue that volume measurements have to be taken into account when determining presynaptic bouton density. Furthermore, perinatal asphyxia led to region-specific changes in presynaptic bouton numbers and it worsened the age-related cognitive impairment.

Phosphorylated TH and total TH immunoreactivities were co-localized exclusively in retinal neurons whose shape and location are characteristic of dopaminergic interplexiform cells. Phosphorylated TH was weak to absent in darkness, but light strongly stimulated phosphorylation in all the three serine residues. Light-induced phosphorylation of TH induction by light was uniformly blocked by a combination of NMDA and AMPA glutamate receptor antagonists. In darkness, the combination of NMDA+AMPA induced phosphosphorylation of TH at serines 19 and 40 but it was weak at serine 31. A GABA A antagonist had the same effect. An agonist of depolarizing (ON) bipolar cells, l -(+)-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid, did not prevent light-induced phosphorylated TH formation. Carbachol, a non-specific cholinergic agonist, selectively induced phosphorylation of TH at serine 31 in darkness, an effect which was blocked by the nicotinic antagonist, d-tubocurarine. These results show that retinal circuits involving glutamatergic, GABAergic and cholinergic synapses influence phospho-TH formation at different serine residues in this enzyme.

Spatial sampling of the laminar pattern is performed with density profiles, followed by multivariate analysis of the profiles shape, which locates the cytoarchitectonic borders between neighboring cortical areas at sites where the laminar pattern changes significantly. The borders are then mapped to a human brain atlas system comprising tools for three dimensional reconstruction, visualization and morphometric analysis. A sample of brains with labeled cortical areas is warped into the reference brain of the atlas system in order to generate a population map of the cortical areas, which describes the intersubject variability in spatial conformation of cortical areas.

It is possible that histamine has first evolved as a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. We established sensitive quantitative in situ hybridization methods for histamine H 1 and H 2 receptors and HDC, to study the modulation of brain histaminergic system under pathophysiological conditions. A transient increase in H 1 receptor expression was seen in the dentate gyrus and striatum after a single injection of kainic acid, a glutamate analog. H 1 antagonists are known to increase duration of convulsions, and increased brain histamine is associated with reduced convulsions in animal models of epilepsy. No HDC mRNA was detected in brain vessels by in situ hybridization, which suggests lack of histamine synthesis by brain endothelial cells. This was verified by lack of HDC mRNA in a rat brain endothelial cell line, RBE4 cells. Both H 1 and H 2 receptor mRNA was found in this cell line, and the expression of both receptors was downregulated by dexamethasone. The findings are in agreement with the concept that histamine regulates bloodbrain barrier permeability through H 1 and H 2 receptor mediated mechanisms. Hibernation is characterized by a drastic reduction of central functions. The activity of most transmitter systems is maintained at a very low level. Surprisingly, histamine levels and turnover were clearly elevated in hibernating ground squirrels, and the density of histamine-containing fibers was higher than in euthermic animals. It is possible that histamine actively maintains the low activity of other transmitters during the hibernation state.",

The CA1 exhibited the highest level of D 2 mRNA expression. By E1925 the hippocampal formation underwent rapid morphological maturation. D 2 mRNA expression became more uniform and dense in the ammonic subfield. At all ages the subiculum appeared more mature morphologically but less intensely stained for D 2 mRNA than the ammonic fields. In the entorhinal cortex D 2 mRNA expression was most conspicuous in the future layer II at all ages. In the temporal neocortex D 2 mRNA-positive cells were detected in the subplate and cortical plate. Differentiation of the cortical plate was accompanied by concentration of D 2 mRNA-positive cells in layer V. The most conspicuous cells expressing D 2 mRNA were found in the marginal zone of all regions and resembled CajalRetzius cells in morphology and location. Density of putative CajalRetzius cells expressing D 2 mRNA decreased with development.

Although many afferent and efferent connections to this nucleus have been described, it has been clear for many years, based on chemical neuroanatomical criteria, that there are projections to this nucleus that remain undescribed. A variety of methods including high performance liquid chromatography, immunohistochemistry and receptor autoradiography have identified high levels of catecholamine transmitters, the presence of enzymes involved in the synthesis of catecholamines such as tyrosine hydroxylase and a variety of catecholamine receptor sub-types in the HVc of several songbird species. However, no definitive projections to HVc have been described from cells groups known to synthesize catecholamines. These projections were analyzed in the present study by retrograde tract tracing combined with immunocytochemistry for tyrosine hydroxylase. The origin of the catecholaminergic inputs to HVc were determined based exclusively on birds in which injections of the retrograde tracer (latex fluospheres) were confined within the cytoarchitectonic boundaries of the nucleus. Retrogradely transported latex fluospheres were found mainly in cells of two dopaminergic nuclei, the mesencephalic central gray (A11) and, to a lesser extend, the area ventralis of Tsai (A10; homologous to the ventral tegmental area of mammals). A few retrogradely-labelled cells were also found in the noradrenergic nucleus subceruleus (A6). Most of these retrogradely-labelled cells were also tyrosine hydroxylase-positive. Other catecholaminergic nuclei were devoid of retrograde label. These data converge with others studies to indicate that HVc receives discrete dopaminergic and noradrenergic inputs.

In this study, frozen cryostat sections from hippocampal and cerebellar regions of two rat strains and cerebellar and cerebral regions from a human brain were analyzed to determine the potential impact of these factors on estimates of neuron number obtained using the optical disector. Neuronal nuclei and nucleoli were clearly present in thin sections of snap-frozen rat (3 m) and human (6 m) tissue, indicating that neuronal nuclei/nucleoli are not unavoidably lost from unprotected section surfaces of unembedded tissue.

It also reports new findings on the presence of TH-immunoreactive (ir) neurons in the striatum. Our data show the existence of nigrostriatal TH-ir axons that provide collaterals arborizing in the globus pallidus and subthalamic nucleus. These thin and varicose collaterals emerge from thick and smooth axons that course along the main output pathways of the basal ganglia, including the ansa lenticularis, the lenticular fasciculus and Wilson's pencils. We postulate that this extrastriatal innervation, which allows nigral dopaminergic neurons to directly affect the pallidum and subthalamic nucleus, plays a critical role in the functional organisation of human basal ganglia. The TH-ir fibres that reach the striatum arborize according to a highly heterogeneous pattern. At rostral striatal levels, numerous small TH-poor zones embedded in a TH-rich matrix correspond to calbindin-poor striosomes and calbindin-rich extrastriosomal matrix, respectively. At caudal striatal levels, in contrast, striosomes display a TH immunostaining that is more intense than that of the matrix. A significant number of small, oval, aspiny TH-ir neurons scattered throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the caudate nucleus and putamen, together with a few larger, multipolar, spiny TH-ir neurons lying principally within the ventral portion of the putamen, were disclosed in human.

Labeled neurons in the intermediate gray layer were small to medium in size, and mostly of stellate morphology. Neurons in the deepest layers had mostly vertical or stellate morphologies. NADPHd labeled fibers formed dense patches of terminal boutons within the intermediate gray layer and streams of fibers within the deepest layers of SC.

Other structures such as the thalamus and amygdaloid body also expressed the  1 receptor mRNA although to a lesser extent. In murine peripheral tissues, strong hybridization signals were observed in the liver, white pulp of the spleen and the adrenal gland. In the postmortem human brain, moderate levels of  1 receptor mRNA, distributed in a laminar fashion, were detected in the temporal cortex with the deeper laminae (IVVI) being particularly enriched. In the hippocampal formation, the strongest hybridization signals were observed in the dentate gyrus while all other subfields of the human hippocampal formation expressed lower levels of the  1 receptor mRNA. Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides against the purported  1 receptor were used next to investigate the possible role of this receptor in dizocilpine (MK-801)/NMDA receptor blockade-induced amnesia. Following a continuous intracerebroventricular infusion of a specific  1 receptor antisense into the third ventricle (0.4 nmol/h for 5 days),  1 /[ 3 H](+)pentazocine binding was significantly reduced in mouse brain membrane homogenates while a scrambled antisense control was without effect. Moreover, the  1 receptor antisense treatments (5 nmol/injection, every 12 h3 or 0.4 nmol/h for 5 days) attenuated (+)MK-801/NMDA receptor blockade-induced cognitive deficits in the treated mice while a scrambled antisense control had no effect. Taken together, these results demonstrate the widespread, but discrete, distribution of the  1 receptor mRNA in the mammalian central nervous system. Moreover, antisense treatments against the purported  1 receptor gene reduced specific  1 /[ 3 H](+)pentazocine binding and modulated cognitive behaviors associated with NMDA receptor blockade providing further evidence for the functional relevance of the cloned gene.",

Its localization in the human hypothalamus is less well studied. Hence, we investigated the anatomical distribution of neuronal nitric oxide synthase in the human supraoptic nucleus by use of immunohistochemical and enzyme histochemical techniques. The immunohistochemical localization of NOS was studied in 31 matched human hypothalami (13 control cases, eight depressed patients and ten schizophrenics). NADPH-diaphorase studies were carried out on seven additional hypothalami (three normal brains, four schizophrenics). Apparent inter-individual differences exist with regard to the occurrence of the enzyme in supraoptic neurons.

In seven cases (three controls, two schizophrenics, two depressives) a population of nitrergic nerve cells was seen in the dorsomedial part of the nucleus. This group of cells also stained for NADPH-diaphorase. Also, there were a few NOS-immunopositive neurons scattered throughout the nucleus.

There is, however, no indication of the involvement of AGE-induced crosslinking of alpha -synuclein in very early stages of the disease. In this study, we observed that AGEs and alpha -synuclein are similarly distributed in very early Lewy bodies in the human brain in cases with incidental Lewy body disease. These cases might be viewed as pre-Parkinson patients, i.e. patients who came for autopsy before the possible development of clinical signs of PD. AGEs are both markers of transition metal induced oxidative stress as well as, inducers of protein crosslinking and free radical formation by chemical and cellular processes.

The calcium-binding protein-containing neurons showed different developmental patterns. The first appearance of parvalbumin immunoreactive nonpyramidal cells was observed at P7. Parvalbumin immunoreactivity was elicited by the sequence from CA3 to CA1 to reach an adult-like distribution pattern, which was reached at P60, while calbindin D-28k immunoreactivity appeared from P0, including pyramidal and nonpyramidal cells.

We present a dissection approach in which the region for analysis must be used for unbiased sampling and also be available for paraffin-embedded neuropathologic work-up. Following fixation, a block consisting of the entire region of interest is removed intact and using a multibladed knife the block is subsectioned in the coronal plane at regular intervals. Alternate blocks are chosen for either paraffin embedding and destined to neuropathologic evaluation or are processed for stereology. The stereology blocks can be either cryoprotected or placed in phosphate buffer and are serially sectioned on a cryostat or a Vibratome. Preliminary analyses using this approach have provided reliable estimates of the total number of different neuronal populations and disease-related lesions in a variety of human and non-human banked specimens.

The tracing experiments revealed the relative contributions of the various GRP-positive subpopulations to the innervation of the circular muscle and the mucosa.

During pathological conditions, superoxide and nitric oxide (NO) rapidly form peroxynitrite, a potent cytotoxin, causing symptoms referred to as oxidative stress response. Superoxide is controlled by enzymes such as manganese- or copperzinc-dependent superoxide dismutase (MnSOD, CuZnSOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and antioxidants derived from heme oxygenase (HO) activity such as biliverdin and bilirubin. NO derives from 3 NO-synthases (NOS IIII) from which the calcium-dependent NOS-I and III are activated rapidly due to hyperexcitation. We studied the induction of COX-2 by immunohistochemistry at days 1, 2 and 5 following cortical photothrombosis in normal and MK-801 treated rats. The results showed a weak constitutive, neuronal expression of COX-2 in cortex and amygdala. Layers II+III contained considerably more COX-2 than infragranular layers. One and 2 days following injury COX-2 was highly upregulated in the supragranular layers of the whole injured hemisphere compared with sham-operated animals and compared to the contralateral unlesioned hemisphere, whereas at day 5 COX-2 levels had returned to baseline. MK-801 treatment caused a reduction in COX-2 upregulation at day one and by day 2 no significant differences between injured and contralateral hemisphere were measurable. COX-2 positive neurons were found in close association with NOS-I containing neurons and their fibers but were not colocalized. In addition, codistribution of COX-2 was found with HO-1, CuZn-SOD and GPx containing cells, whereas COX-2 was colocalized with HO-2 and/or MnSOD in cortical neurons.",

Chronic use of cocaine may lead to a serotonin-deficit form of 5-HT dysregulation. We have examined the status of the 5-HT transporter (SERT) using ligand binding and autoradiographic methods in subgroups of cocaine overdose deaths. Quantitative autoradiography of [ 125 I]RTI-55 was used to map and measure the effect of chronic cocaine use on SERT densities in the striatum, substantia nigra, amygdala, and adjacent paralimbic cortical areas of cocaine overdose (CO) victims with and without preterminal evidence of excited delirium (ED). SERT densities were elevated in the nucleus accumbens and throughout the anterior and posterior sectors of striatum in CO victims compared with age-matched and drug-free control subjects. In contrast, SERT densities were increased significantly in the anterior striatum, but not the posterior sectors in ED victims. Significant elevations in SERT were measured in the orbitofrontal gyrus (Brodmann area 11), the anterior portion of the insular cortex and the cingulate gyrus (Brodmann area 24) in CO and ED victims. Saturation binding site analysis demonstrated an increase in the density of RTI-55 binding sites with no change in the affinity of the radioligand for the SERT. Chronic cocaine exposure upregulated SERT densities in the substantia nigra of the CO, but not ED victims. The lack of SERT upregulation in the substania nigra and posterior striatum suggests the possibility of a distinct phenotype for fatal ED victims that exhibited an acute onset of bizarre and violent behavior prior to death. Adaptive changes in the SERT densities may contribute to depressed mood and drug craving associated with acute cocaine abstinence.",

DADTI-IR nerve elements first appeared in the neuroepithelium of ventral mesencephalon on ED 13. From there, positive cell bodies migrated towards the mantle layer until they invaded the whole ventral mesencephalic tegmentum. They then reached their definitive position, corresponding to a subpopulation of the A8, A9 and A10 dopaminergic neurones that had been constantly observed also in the adult age. From ED 15-17, DADTI-positive nerve fibres appeared in the medial forebrain bundle, the neostriatum anlage, the accumbens nucleus, the olfactory tubercle, the fasciculus retroflexus, and the prefrontal cortex. All these locations have also been found in adult rats. From ED 14 onwards, transient DADTI-IR somata and nerve fibres were observed in retinal neuroepithelium, optic pathways as far as the superior colliculus, CA3 hippocampal field, reticular formation in the medulla oblongata. All these locations gradually disappeared either before birth (medulla oblongata) or within the first 3 weeks after birth.

Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been documented in song control nuclei at various stages of development. Its high affinity receptor (tyrosine kinase B; trkB) is also in the song system, at least at around 1 month of age. The present study was designed to more completely describe the timing and potential location of BDNF action by investigating trkB expression during sexual differentiation of the song control nuclei. The pattern of immunoreactivity to a trkB antibody was examined in male and female zebra finches at post-hatching days 360. Labeling in somata and neuropil appeared to define the telencephalic components of the motor pathway (high vocal center and robust nucleus of the archistriatum) for song production in males from days 30 to 60, and in females on days 45 and 60 (high vocal center). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the receptor, and its ligand BDNF, play a role in processes related to song learning in both sexes, including perhaps the motor component exhibited by developing males.",

Convergent information indicates that interneurons in the hippocampus and other forebrain structures are decreased in number and function in subjects with schizophrenia. Among the neurochemical markers that are decreased in the hippocampus are synapsin I, cholecystokinin, somatostatin, glutamic acid decarboxylase, and nitric oxide synthase. GABA uptake sites and the GABA synthetic enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase are also diminished. Included among these findings is decreased binding of -bungarotoxin, which binds to low-affinity nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, such as the 7-nicotinic receptor. Co-labeling experiments in rodents indicate that these markers are expressed on overlapping populations of hippocampal interneurons. Thus, the finding of decreased neurochemical function of hippocampal interneurons is a widely replicated finding, with different groups reporting markedly similar findings using independent post mortem samples and different neurochemical strategies. Decreased -bungarotoxin binding or decreased 7-nicotinic receptor immunoreactivity has also been found in the frontal cortex and in the nucleus reticularis thalami of schizophrenic subjects. The 7-nicotinic receptor subunit gene on chromosome 15q14 is a site of heritability for schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder, and in, particular, for a deficit in inhibitory neuronal function associated with these illnesses. Thus, the post mortem data are further supported by psychophysiologic and genetic investigations that indicate a deficit in inhibitory interneuronal function, involving the 7-nicotinic receptor. The 7-receptor is a ligand-gated ion channel that admits calcium ions into cells, and it has been proposed to have various developmental roles. Its malfunction may be part of the developmental pathogenesis of schizophrenia.",

There is, however, no indication of the involvement of AGE-induced crosslinking of -synuclein in very early stages of the disease. In this study, we observed that AGEs and -synuclein are similarly distributed in very early Lewy bodies in the human brain in cases with incidental Lewy body disease. These cases might be viewed as pre-Parkinson patients, i.e. patients who came for autopsy before the possible development of clinical signs of PD. AGEs are both markers of transition metal induced oxidative stress as well as, inducers of protein crosslinking and free radical formation by chemical and cellular processes.

The development of autonomous vehicles for urban driving needs real-time information from vehicles and road network to optimize traffic flows. In traffic agent-based models, each vehicle is an agent, while the road network is the environment. Cognitive agents are able to reason on the perceived data, to evaluate the information obtained by reasoning, and to learn and respond, preserving their self-sufficiency, independency, self-determination, and self-reliance. In this paper, a bio-inspired cognitive agent for autonomous urban vehicles routing optimization is proposed. The use of selected bio-inspired analyzing techniques, which are commonly employed to investigate the topological and functional features of a metabolic network, allows the agent to analyze the structural aspects of a road network, find its extreme pathways and outline the balanced flow combinations. This approach optimizes traffic flows over network, minimizes road congestions, and maximizes the number of autonomous vehicles reaching their destination target. Agent behavior has been tested using data coming from Palermo urban road network, Italy, while the adopted bio-inspired analysis techniques have been compared with the A&#x002A; literature algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the approach permits to find a better global routing optimization solution.

Two novel features are presented here starting with the novel skill acquisition in the complex domain of learning a double tap tactile gesture between two humanoid robots. During reproduction, the robot can either perform a double tap or prioritize to receive a higher reward by performing a single tap instead. Second, HSOME has been extended to recall past observations and reproduce rhythmic patterns in the absence of input relevant to the joints by priming initially the reproduction of specific skills with an input.

In this paper, we face these issues presenting a framework that integrates cognitive control, executive attention, and hierarchical plan execution. In the proposed approach, the execution of structured tasks is guided by top-down (task-oriented) and bottom-up (stimuli-driven) attentional processes that affect behavior selection and activation, while resolving conflicts and decisional impasses. Specifically, attention is here deployed to stimulate the activations of multiple hierarchical behaviors orienting them toward the execution of finalized and interactive activities. On the other hand, this framework allows a human to indirectly and smoothly influence the robotic task execution exploiting attention manipulation. We provide an overview of the overall system architecture discussing the framework at work in different case studies. In particular, we show that multiple concurrent tasks can be effectively orchestrated and interleaved in a flexible manner; moreover, in a human-robot interaction setting, we test and assess the effectiveness of attention manipulation for interactive plan guidance.",

The categories are described using action-effect relations, i.e., sensorimotor contingencies rather than more static shape or appearance representation. The framework provides a functionality to classify objects and the resulting categories, associating a class with a specific module. We demonstrate the performance of the framework by studying a pushing behavior in robots, encoding the sensorimotor contingencies and their predictability with Gaussian Processes. We show how entropy-based action selection can improve object classification and how functional categories emerge from the similarities of effects observed among the objects. We also show how a multidimensional action space can be realized by parameterizing pushing using both position and velocity.",

First, we create a set of primary tool functionalities, which we speculate is related to the possible functions of the human hand. The function of a tool is found by comparing it to this set. For this, the unknown tool is segmented, using a data-driven method, into its parts and evaluated using the geometrical part constellations against the training set. We demonstrate that various tools and even uncommon tool-versions can be recognized. The system &#x201c;understands&#x201d; that objects can be used as makeshift replacements. For example, a helmet or a hollow skull can be used to transport water. Our system supersedes state-of-the-art recognition algorithms in recognition and generalization performance. To support the conjecture of a possible cognitive hand-to-tool transfer we analyze, at the end of this study, primary tools by also incorporating tool-dynamics. We create an ontology of tool functions where we find only 32 of them.

Many researchers have explored human-object interactions to decode behavior-related information. However, current methods only model probabilistic correlations between objects and activities. Their applications are usually limited to fixed environments and fixed sets of activities. They are unable to deal with variability in the real environments due to the lack of the human-like cognitive reasoning process. To address this urgent problem, we developed an Object Functional Role Perspective method to endow a robot with comprehensive behavior understanding. Instead of using specific objects to identify an activity, our role-based method models the human cognitive process during task performing by analyzing object selection and object interaction. Then activity-related information, such as activity feasibility, likely plan, and urgent need of an activity, is inferred in order to improve a robot&#x2019;s cognition level for comprehensive behavior understanding. Through a large amount of human behavior observations, this cognitive knowledge is constructed using a Markov random field (MRF) model.

However, the acoustic qualities of speech produced by the infant and caregiver are quite different and therefore cannot be fully explained by imitation. Instead, the interaction itself may have an important role to play, but the mechanism is still unclear. In this paper, we review studies addressing this topic based on explicit interaction mechanisms using computer simulations and/or real vocal robots.

Then, a model of its body capabilities is also learnt, which serves to establish the likelihood of success of the actions needed to imitate the sequence of sounds and to correct the errors made by the underlying kinematic controller.

In this paper, we demonstrate that cross-situational learning resolves the issues of referential uncertainty for bootstrapping a language for episodic space and time; therefore removing the need to specify the underlying sensors or representations a priori. The requirements for robots to be able to link words to their designated meanings are presented and analyzed within the Lingodroids-language learning robots-framework. We present a study that compares predetermined associations given a priori against unconstrained learning using cross-situational learning.

Sensory symptoms are mild or absent. Frequently, tendon reflexes are suppressed or diminished. There is no sign of any involvement of the central nervous system or bulbar lesion. Cranial nerves are rarely involved. The course of the disease may be progressive and generally it lasts several years. The hallmark of the diagnosis is the presence of partial focal motor conduction blocks, detected by electrophysiology.

Malignant gliomas remain a major issue in neuro-oncology, due to their high incidence, their poor prognosis and the challenge of their treatment. Whereas clinical and radiological diagnosis may be easily established on a routine basis via CT or MRI imaging, the gap between the growing understanding of their biology and the lack of any cure benefit for the patients remains a major issue. Neuropathological classification of malignant gliomas is not yet settled, and recent methods based on immuno-histology and molecular genetics provide new data that question the accuracy of pure morphological diagnosis, and modify previous understanding of the morphologically suggested oncogenetic lineage of gliomas. Neurosurgical procedures change:  total resection is the aim, and optimal resection of the tumour tissue may be obtained using new per-operative technologies. The development of nano-neurosurgery is already part of many protocols lying upon local depots of cytotoxic or immunomodulatory agents. Radiotherapy has also been improved through three-dimensional dosimetry and conformational irradiation. Chemotherapies have been disappointing, but new drugs and new targets to the autocrine and paracrine loops have initiated an era of combined drug protocols, some to be used via nano-neurosurgical methods and tools. Immunotherapies are currently evaluated either as specific targeting tools or as a true immunological modulation against tumour cells. Gene therapies, after disappointing results of the gancyclovir suicide gene strategy, are now attempting to act upon biological characteristics of tumour cells. In summary, malignant glioma treatments remain unsatisfactory, despite considerable amount of clinical research.

We could find three principal types of steady states when the system parameters change slowly: (i) the model produce a constant output when it is under a state of stable equilibrium point with a constant input. If a small perturbation is introduced (e.g., noisy input), the output changes into noise without oscillatory components, which is related to the normal background activity or low-voltage rapid activity, (ii) Hopf bifurcations lead to stable limit cycles, which we call Hopf cycles. The model generates a rhythmic oscillating output when it is under a state of Hopf cycles, which is related to slow rhythmic activity or slow quasi-sinusoidal activity, (iii) global bifurcations lead to homoclinic limit cycles that appear suddenly at high amplitude, which we call spike cycles. In general, the spike cycles are not harmonic but they have a spike-like appearance (anharmonic oscillation). The model produces a spike-like output when it is under a state of spike cycles, which is related to the sustained discharge of spikes.

The ALS cases are modeled as three progressively severe uniform axonal dysfunctions along the human motor nerve fiber which is simulated by our temperature-dependent multi-layered numerical model. The results show that the polarizing electrotonic potentials in the ALS1 case are quite similar to those in the normal case during hypothermia. Their defining currents are caused by the activation of potassium fast (ProQuest: Formulae and/or non-USASCII text omitted) and slow (ProQuest: Formulae and/or non-USASCII text omitted) channels in the nodal and internodal axolemma beneath the myelin sheath. Except in the ALS3 case at 20[degrees]C, where the accommodative processes are blocked by depolarizing stimuli, in the ALS2 and ALS3 cases during hypothermia these stimuli activate the classical \"transient\" Na super(+) channels in the nodal and internodal axolemma beneath the myelin sheath. And this leads to action potential generations during the early parts of electrotonic responses in all compartments along the fiber length. Only in the ALS3 case after the termination of long-lasting subthreshold hyperpolarizing stimuli, action potential generations are obtained in the late parts of electrotonic potentials along the fiber length. In comparison to the normal case, in the gradually severe ALS cases, the depolarizing electrotonic potentials gradually increase, while the hyperpolarizing electrotonic potentials gradually decrease during hyperthermia. However, the repetitive firings are not obtained in these polarizing electrotonic potentials. The results show that the accommodative processes to depolarizing stimuli in the ALS3 case are more likely to be blocked during hypothermia than hyperthermia.

Regulatory domains of gap junction protein subunit connexins in electrical synapses between alpha cells by extracellular and intracellular ligands investigated by dual whole-patch clamp recordings. I examined how passage currents through electrical synapses between alpha cells are modulated by specific antibodies against connexin36 proteins, and extracellular or intracellular application of ligands. Control conditions led us to observe large passage currents between connected cells and adequate transjunctional conductance (Gj) (1.35+ or -0.51nS). Experimental results show that high level of intracellular cyclic AMP within examined cells suppress electrical synapses between the neighboring cells. Gj between examined cells reduced to 0.15+ or -0.04nS. Under application of dopamine (1.25+ or -0.06nS) or intracellular cyclic GMP (0.98+ or -0.23nS), however, Gj also remains as in the control level. Intracellular application of an antibody against the cytoplasmic loop of connexin36 reduced Gj (0.98+ or -0.23nS). Cocktail of the antibody against cytoplasmic connexin36 and intracellular cyclic AMP leaves Gj as in the level by single involvement of the cytoplasmic antibody. The elimination of Gj by the cytoplasmic antibody was in a dose-dependent manner.

In addition, disruption of this coherence may change the horizontal perception of SAM. In this study, we investigated the changes of Cross-Frequency Coupling (CFC) in EEG signals from parietal and occipital cortices during horizontal and vertical perception of SAM. Our results suggested that while the strength of CFC in parietal electrodes showed no significant change, CFC in P3-P4 electrode-pair demonstrated a significant correlation during horizontal perception of SAM. Therefore, the CFC between theta- and gamma-band oscillations seems to be correlated with changes in functional interactions between brain regions.

The results show that the classical \"transient\" sodium current (I sub(Na)) contributes mainly to the nodal action potential generation in the normal and abnormal cases for the temperature range of 20-39[degrees]C, as the contribution of fast and slow potassium currents (I sub(Kf) and I sub(Ks)) to the total ionic current (I sub(i)) is negligible.

The ionic channels beneath the myelin sheath are insensitive to the short-lasting current stimuli and do not contribute to the internodal action potential generation for the normal and abnormal cases in the whole investigated temperature range. Nevertheless that the uniform axonal dysfunction progressively increases in the nodal and internodal segments of each next simulated ALS case, the action potentials cannot be regarded as definitive indicators for the progressive degrees of this disease, when the temperature is changed from 20[degrees]C to 42[degrees]C.

Hemodialysis seems to originate an inflammatory state of the cerebral tissue reflected by increased OS, while expected to decrease since hemodialysis eliminates free radicals responsible for OS. Considering adrenal function deficiencies, sensitivity to OS and assessed hyponatremia and hypercalcemia, adrenal function deficiencies is strongly suspected in both patients. This probably contributes to amplify brain plasticity and a reorganization of functional control after hemodialysis that is compared to earlier reported studies. Brain plasticity and functional control reorganization was revealed by BOLD-fMRI with a remarkable sensitivity.

Methods: Eleven healthy participants aged 18-40 years undertook the Stroop task 90 min after taking an oral dose of either BZP (200 mg), DEX (20 mg) or placebo. Results: BZP induced a greater increase in activation than DEX in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) during the Stroop task. DEX increased BOLD signal in the thalamus and decreased it in the IFG in comparison to placebo. Conclusion: Despite BZP and DEX reportedly inducing similar subjective effects, there are different patterns of neural activation.

In this work, we study separation efficiency of the DG for different rates of neurogenesis of interneurons and excitatory neurons using a novel computational model in which we assume an increase in the synaptic efficacy between excitatory neurons and interneurons and then its decay over time.

The results show an important role of an optimal neurogenesis rate of interneurons and excitatory neurons in the DG in efficient separation of inputs from the EC in pattern separation tasks.

After puberty, they were exposed to either a larger and delayed or smaller and immediate reward (tolerance to delay of reward task). Acute MPH (3 mg/Kg. i.p.) was used to suppress and/or regulate impulsive behavior. Our results show that only neonatally handled male adult Wistar rats exhibit impulsive behavior with no significant differences in monoamine levels in the medial prefrontal cortex, together with a decreased response to MPH.

In the present study, we investigated LFP changes induced by HFS of afferent axons in the hippocampal CA1 region of urethane-anesthetized rats by using a proper algorithm of artifact removal. Afterward, the LFP changes in the frequency bands of [delta][delta] , [theta][theta] , [alpha][alpha] , [beta][beta] and [gamma][gamma] rhythms were studied by power spectrum analysis and coherence analysis for the recorded signals collected in the pyramidal layer and in the stratum radiatum of CA1 region before, during and after 1-min long 100 and 200 Hz HFS. Results showed that the power of LFP rhythms in higher-frequency band ([gamma][gamma] rhythm) increased in the pyramidal layer and the power of LFP rhythms in lower-frequency bands ([theta][theta] , [alpha][alpha] and [beta][beta] rhythms) decreased in the stratum radiatum during HFS. The synchronization of [theta][theta] rhythm decreased and the synchronization of [gamma][gamma] rhythm increased during HFS in the stratum radiatum.

A novel evolutionary algorithm, the backtracking search optimization algorithm is used to find the optimal frequency band and the optimal combination of frequency band and time segment. The former is searched by a frequency window with changing width of which starting and ending points are selected by the backtracking optimization algorithm; the latter is searched by the same frequency window and an additional time window with fixed width.

Such ultraweak photon emission (UPE), also named biophoton emission, reflects the cellular (and body) oxidative status. Recently, a growing body of evidence shows that UPE may play an important role in the basic functioning of living cells. Moreover, interesting evidences are beginning to emerge that UPE may well play an important role in neuronal functions. In fact, biophotons are byproducts in cellular metabolism and produce false signals (e.g., retinal discrete dark noise) but on the other side neurons contain many light sensitive molecules that makes it hard to imagine how they might not be influenced by UPE, and thus UPE may carry informational contents. Here, we investigate UPE in the brain from different points of view such as experimental evidences, theoretical modeling, and physiological significance.",

The majority of the remaining 68 units were considered to be DS neurons of the nBOR. The results of our study suggest that in the nBOR area there might be four subtypes of the tegmental and retinal DS units that respond selectively to stimuli moving in the dorso-ventral, ventro-dorsal, caudo-rostral and rostro-caudal directions. The receptive field (RF) sizes of the nBOR DS neurons were estimated to be about 30-60[degrees], while those for the retinal units were significantly smaller - just 6-8[degrees]. In response to abrupt darkening within the units' RFs, both the nBOR DS neurons and the RGC DS units respond by a weak discharge.

These cells are involved in a variety of fast neural computation processes, from the control of eye movements to the detection of prey by the archer fish. The standard model for this mechanism in mammalian retina is well understood and is based on the asymmetry of inhibitory and excitatory inputs to the retinal ganglion cells. However, it remains unclear whether the mechanism that underlies direction selectivity is similar across animal classes. This study reports a pharmacological investigation designed to elucidate the mechanism that underlies motion detection in the archer fish retina. Direction selectivity in the retina was characterized under the influence of specific channel blockers that are known to be present in the different types of neurons of the retina. The results show that the direction-selective mechanism in the archer fish retina is modified only when the inhibitory channels of GABA and Glycine are manipulated. This suggests that the mechanism of direction selectivity in the archer fish retina is fundamentally different from the mechanism of direction selectivity in the mammalian retina.",

They were arranged in the sequence of the color circle in humans separated by gray of medium brightness. We found 22 units with best responses between orange, red and pink. About 12 of these red-sensitive units were of the opponent \"red-ON/blue-green-OFF\" type as found in retinal bipolar- and ganglion cells as well. Most of them were also activated or inhibited by black and/or white. Some units responded specifically to red either with activation or inhibition. 18 units were sensitive to blue and/or green, 10 of them to both colors and most of them to black as well. They were inhibited by red, and belonged to the opponent \"blue-green-ON/red-OFF\" type. Other units responded more selectively either to blue, to green or to purple. Two units were selectively sensitive to yellow. A total of 15 units were sensitive to motion, stimulated by an excentrically rotating black and white random dot pattern. Activity of these units was also large when a red-green random dot pattern of high L-cone contrast was used. Activity dropped to zero when the red-green pattern did not modulate the L-cones.

The dynamics of such networks during cognitive activity between stimulus and response using multi-channel electroencephalogram (EEG), recorded from 16 healthy human participants are explored in this research. Successive EEG segments of 500 ms duration starting from the onset of cognitive stimulation have been used to analyze and understand the cognitive dynamics. The approach employs a combination of signal processing techniques, nonlinear statistical measures and graph-theoretical analysis. The efficacy of this approach in detecting and tracking cognitive load induced changes in EEG data is clearly demonstrated using graph metrics. It is revealed that most cognitive activity occurs within approximately 500 ms of the stimulus presentation in addition to temporal variability in the FBNs. It is shown that mutual information (MI), a nonlinear measure, produces good correlations between the EEG channels thus enabling the construction of FBNs which are sensitive to cognitive load induced changes in EEG. Analyses of the dynamics of FBNs and the visualization approach reveal hard to detect subtle changes in cognitive function and hence may lead to a better understanding of cognitive processing in the brain. The techniques exploited have the potential to detect human cognitive dysfunction (impairments).",

These toads belong to the ancient superfamily Discoglossoidea, a sister group to all extant Anura except for two small families.

Therefore, we designed an experiment with the goal of investigating FM and proprioception role in subjects' perception of their hand's position. The results suggest that FM role needs to be considered when studying the perceived position of the limbs.

Here we introduce a correlation-based single trial analysis method for fMRI data analysis to deal with the low signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio and variability of the HRF in response to repeated, identical auditory stimuli. The correlation technique identifies the \"active\" trials, i.e., those showing a robust hemodynamic response among all single trials. Using data collected from 14 healthy subjects, it was found that the correlation method can find significant differences between brain areas and brain states in actual fMRI data. Also, the correlation-based method confirmed that the superior temporal gyrus (STG), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and thalamus (THA) are involved in auditory information processing in general, and the involvement of the bilateral STG, right THA and left DLPFC in sensory gating. In contrast, conventional analysis failed to find any regions involved in sensory gating.

The mechanism by which SACs show Ca super(2+) bias for centrifugal motion is yet to be determined with precision. Recent morphological studies support a presynaptic delay in glutamate receptor activation induced Ca super(2+) release from bipolar cells preferentially contacting SACs. However, bipolar cells are known to be electrotonically coupled so time delays between the bipolar cells that provide input to SACs seem unlikely. Using fluorescent microscopy and imunnostaining, we found that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is omnipresent in the soma extending to the distal processes of SACs.

Single unit responses of the DS GCs were recorded in intact fish from their axon terminals in TO. Goldfish DS GCs projecting to TO were shown to comprise six physiological types according to their selectivity to sign of stimulus contrast (ON and OFF units) and their preferred directions: three directions separated by 120[degrees]. These units, characterized by relatively small receptive fields and remarkable spatial resolution should be classified as local motion detectors. In addition to the retinal DS GCs, other kinds of DS units were extracellularly recorded in the superficial and deep sublaminae of tectum. Some features of their responses suggested that they originated from tectal neurons (TNs). Contrary to DS GCs which are characterized by small RFs and use separate ON and OFF channels, DS TNs have extra-large RFs and ON-OFF type responses. DS TNs were shown to select four preferred directions. Three of them are compatible with those already selected on the retinal level.

In that multimodality experiment, we focused on how inner-quiet information is processed in the human brain, and found evidence of auditory domination from the theta-band activity. However, a simple quantitative description of these three frequency bands is lacking, and no studies have assessed the effects of peacefulness on the emotional state. Therefore, the aim of this study was to use magnetoencephalography to determine if gender differences exist (and when and where) in the frequency interactions underpinning the perception of peacefulness. This study provides evidence of auditory and visual domination in perceptual bias during multimodality processing of peaceful consciousness. The results of power ratio analyses suggest that the values of the theta/alpha ratio are associated with a modality as well as hemispheric asymmetries in the anterior-to-posterior direction, which shift from right to left with the auditory to visual stimulations in a peaceful mood. This means that the theta/alpha ratio might be useful for evaluating emotion.
