We hypothesized that enzymesubstrate electrostatic interactions influence substrate specificities of the two isozymes. Among seven positively charged candidate residues in Hex A, at which substitution for the homolgous  residue was performed, only the 424RL mutation resulted in loss of activity toward the electronegative substrate 4methylumbelliferyacetylglucosamine6sulfate (4MUGS).

They were examined regarding: intelligence, comorbid psychopathology, social support of the family, parental stress, and coping. The mean IQ equivalents for the FXS (and the TSC patients) were between 46.1 and 48.8 (58.9 and 60.8) with a relatively homogeneous profile. The psychiatric comorbidity was higher for the FXS patients: 18.4% (25%) had no, 46.7% (25%) multiple diagnoses (DSMIV), 89.8% (68.8%) had a CBCL (Child Behavior Checklist) total score in the clinical and borderline range. Families with an FXS child had a significantly higher total stress level and a lower degree of resources than the those with a TSC child (QRS; < .01), especially regarding the child characteristics ( < .001) and the physical incapacitation ( < .01) scales. The higher stress in the FXS parents was significantly influenced by the higher rate of psychiatric diagnoses of the FXS children, but not by the general level of intelligence. Social support was high in both groups and inversely correlated with stress. Coping abilities did not differ between the two groups. The higher the stress was perceived in the FXS families, the less parents were able to cope actively and resorted to more passive forms of coping.In conclusion, parents of FXS boys have high level of social support and coping abilities.

Epigenetically correct inheritance of imprinted genes requires appropriate germline specific chromosomal modifications like histone acetylation or DNA methylation. Some of these modified, imprinted genes are organized in clusters as exemplified by the 2 Mb domain on human chromosome 15q11q13. Deletion, uniparental disomy (UPD), or inappropriate imprinting of this chromosomal region results in the neurogenetic disorders PraderWilli syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS), respectively.

Here, we report the complete gene structure of the human HIP gene and present its mutational analysis in HPE patients.

We have identified a Caucasian family with several members suffering from mammary and/or ovarian carcinomas, most of them before the age of 50. The joint occurrence of several other carcinomas in this family, e.g., gastric carcinoma or hypernephromas, alerted our interest to study possible molecular causes. The index patient had breast cancer at age 26, bilateral cancer of the ovaries and Fallopian tubes at age 37, and hypernephroma at 46 years. From DNA of the index patient and her mother, we PCRamplified and determined the nucleotide sequence of all 22 exons coding for the protein and parts of the flanking introns of the BRCA1 gene. Six polymorphic, probably nonconsequential nucleotide exchanges were found in exons 11, 13, and 16. In both women we detected a 10 nucleotide pair insertion in exon 6 of the BRCA1 gene. This insertion led to the truncation of the gene product beyond amino acid 82. RTPCR experiments using oligodeoxyribonucleotide primers located in exons 2 and 10 revealed biallelic expression of the BRCA1 gene in peripheral white blood cells (PWBCs) of the index patient and of normal individuals. The results of a protein truncation test performed with either mRNA from the index patients PWBCs or with subcloned cDNA fragments confirmed the biallelic expression of the normal and the truncated BRCA1 alleles. When studying transcription patterns of the BRCA1 gene, we found several splicing variants in the 5part of the gene involving exons 3, 5, 6, 7, the first codon of exon 8, and exons 9 and 10. In some of these alternate splice products, the RING finger motif encoded by exons 3 and 5 was obliterated. This observation was also made with mRNAs from PWBCs of healthy individuals or from different human cell lines. This alternate splicing pattern is not directly relevant in eliciting the oncogenic phenotype, but may contribute to a reduction in the amount of full length BRCA1 protein below a critical level.",

While cystic fibrosis patients have mutations in both alleles, most of the patients suffering from CFrelated pathologies have mutations in only one allele. Frequently, the second allele is not mutant but polyvariant carrying a combination of alleles of polymorphic loci, called Polyvariant Mutant Genes (PMG) which, as a whole haplotype, contribute to lowering the level of transcripts. The loci involved in these PMG are Tn, TGm (both in intron 8), and M470V (exon 10) of the gene. We have carried out an exhaustive analysis of the gene in order to determine its possible role in 15 azoospermic Spanish patients.

We believe that the latter phenotypes represent incomplete forms of CBAVD. Given the high frequency of severe CF mutations an exhaustive screening of mutations should be offered when assisted reproduction technologies are available.

For one component, some members are newly formed, especially in the Cruciferae. During evolution, higher plants underwent copy number multiplication of various PRC2 components, which occurred independently for each component, without any obvious co-amplification of PRC2 members. Among the amplified members, usually one was well-conserved and the others were more diversified. Gene amplification occurred at different times for different PcG members during green lineage evolution. Certain PRC2 core components or members of them were highly conserved.

Thereby, the development of methods to infer the translatome, which refers to the entirety of mRNAs associated with ribosomes for protein synthesis, has facilitated the discovery of new principles and mechanisms of translation and expanded our view of the underlying logic of protein synthesis. Here, we review the three main methodologies for translatome analysis, and we highlight some of the recent discoveries made using each technique. We first discuss polysomal profiling, a classical technique that involves the separation of mRNAs depending on the number of bound ribosomes using a sucrose gradient, and which has been combined with global analysis tools such as DNA microarrays or high-throughput RNA sequencing to identify the RNAs in polysomal fractions. We then introduce ribosomal profiling, a recently established technique that enables the mapping of ribosomes along mRNAs at near-nucleotide resolution on a global scale. We finally refer to ribosome affinity purification techniques that are based on the cell-typespecific expression of tagged ribosomal proteins, allowing the capture of translatomes from specialized cells in organisms. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of these three main techniques in the pursuit of defining the translatome, and we speculate about future developments.",

Modern genomics tools offer high-throughput, information-rich and increasingly cost-effective approaches for characterizing biological responses to environmental stress, and are important tools within an increasing sophisticated kit for surveiling and assessing impacts of pollutants on marine species. Through the lens of recent research in marine killifish, we illustrate how genomics tools may be useful for screening chemicals and pollutants for biological activity and to reveal specific mechanisms of action. The high dimensionality of transcriptomic responses enables their usage as highly specific fingerprints of exposure, and these fingerprints can be used to diagnose environmental problems. We also emphasize that molecular pathways recruited to respond at physiological timescales are the same pathways that may be targets for natural selection during chronic exposure to pollutants. Gene complement and sequence variation in those pathways can be related to variation in sensitivity to environmental pollutants within and among species. Furthermore, allelic variation associated with evolved tolerance in those pathways could be tracked to estimate the pace of environmental health decline and recovery. We finish by integrating these paradigms into a vision of how genomics approaches could anchor a modernized framework for advancing the predictive capacity of environmental and ecotoxicological science.",

However, the interpretation of whole-exome sequencing data requires expertise in genomic informatics and clinical medicine to ensure the accurate and safe reporting of findings back to the bedside.

Although variation in functional genomics phenotypes is pervasive, our understanding of the consequences of this variation, either in physiological or evolutionary terms, is still rudimentary and thus motivates increased attention to appropriate null models. To date, much of the focus of population functional genomic studies has been on gene expression variation, but other functional genomic data types are just as likely to reveal important insights at the population level, suggesting a pressing need for more studies that go beyond transcription.

Our analysis indicates that the interpretation of transcriptomic data suffers from insufficient understanding of the consequences for whole organism performance and fitness and comes with the risk of supporting only preliminary and superficial statements.

To address this, organisms have evolved extremely faithful modes of replication, DNA repair and chromosome segregation to combat the deleterious effects of an unstable genome. Nonetheless, a small amount of genome instability is the driver of evolutionary change and adaptation, and thus a low level of instability is permitted in populations. While defects in genome maintenance almost invariably reduce fitness in the short term, they can create an environment where beneficial mutations are more likely to occur. The importance of this fact is clearest in the development of human cancer, where genome instability is a well-established enabling characteristic of carcinogenesis. This raises the crucial question: what are the cellular pathways that promote genome maintenance and what are their mechanisms? Work in model organisms, in particular the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , has provided the global foundations of genome maintenance mechanisms in eukaryotes. The development of pioneering genomic tools in S. cerevisiae , such as the systematic creation of mutants in all nonessential and essential genes, has enabled whole-genome approaches to identifying genes with roles in genome maintenance. Here, we review the extensive whole-genome approaches taken in yeast, with an emphasis on functional genomic screens, to understand the genetic basis of genome instability, highlighting a range of genetic and cytological screening modalities.

Cytosine methylation can abrogate or enhance interactions with DNA-binding proteins, or it may have no effect, depending on the context. Despite being only a small chemical change, the addition of a methyl group to cytosine can affect base readout via hydrophobic contacts in the major groove and shape readout via electrostatic contacts in the minor groove. We discuss the recent discovery that CpG methylation increases DNase I cleavage at adjacent positions by an order of magnitude through altering the local 3D DNA shape and the possible implications of this structural insight for understanding the methylation sensitivity of transcription factors (TFs). Additionally, 5-methylcytosines change the stability of nucleosomes and, thus, affect the local chromatin structure and access of TFs to genomic DNA. Given these complexities, it seems unlikely that the influence of DNA methylation on proteinDNA binding can be captured in a small set of general rules.

Study of RNA modifications is a nascent field as yet, and the significance of these marks in controlling cell growth and differentiation is just beginning to be appreciated. The addition of a methyl group to adenosine (N-methyl-6-adenosine) or m6A is the most abundant modification in mammalian mRNAs.

NGS was a major breakthrough in efforts to sequence and dissect the genomes of plants, including bread wheat and its progenitors, which have large, repetitive and complex genomes. Availability of survey sequences of wheat whole genome and its individual chromosomes enabled researchers to predict and assess wheat miRNAs both in the subgenomic and whole genome levels.

With the vast amount of wheat miRNAs identified in recent years, we are approaching to an overall knowledge on the wheat miRNA repertoire. In the following years, more comprehensive research in relation to miRNA conservation or divergence across wheat and its close relatives or progenitors should be performed. Results may serve valuable in understanding both the significant roles of species-specific miRNAs and also provide us information in relation to the dynamics between miRNAs and evolution in wheat.

Their regulation is aimed at controlling the type and amount of pigments produced and the physiological conditions (like pH) at which they are finally stored. In the carotenoid pathway, the color diversity depends on the quantity of pigment produced and the point where the pathway is arrested. TFs in the latter case are accordingly found to influence the sequestration and degradation of these pigments, which determines their final concentration in the tissue. TFs (phytochrome interacting factors, MADS-BOX, HB-ZIP and B-ZIP) also regulate important rate-determining steps, which decide the direction in which the pathway proceeds and the point at which it is terminated. In the absence of a clear pattern of TF-mediated regulation, it is suggested that the carotenoid pathway is more significantly influenced by other regulatory methods which need to be explored. It is expected that common factors affecting these pathways are the ones acting much before the initiation of the biosynthesis of respective pigments.",

In living cells, nucleosome positions are determined by intrinsic histoneDNA sequence preferences, competition between histones and other DNA-binding proteins for genomic sequence, and ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers. We discuss the major energetic contributions to nucleosome formation and remodeling, focusing especially on partial DNA unwrapping off the histone octamer surface. DNA unwrapping enables efficient access to nucleosome-buried binding sites and mediates rapid nucleosome removal through concerted action of two or more DNA-binding factors. High-resolution, genome-scale maps of distances between neighboring nucleosomes have shown that DNA unwrapping and nucleosome crowding (mutual invasion of nucleosome territories) are much more common than previously thought. Ultimately, constraints imposed by nucleosome energetics on the rates of ATP-dependent and spontaneous chromatin remodeling determine nucleosome occupancy genome-wide, and shape pathways of cellular response to environmental stresses.",

Plant genome size research has greatly benefited from the cataloguing of genome size estimates at the Kew Plant DNA C-values Database, and the recent availability of over 50 fully sequenced and published plant genomes. The emerging trend is that plant genomes bloat due to the copy-and-paste proliferation of a few long terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTRs) and aggressively purge these proliferating LTRs through several mechanisms including illegitimate and incomplete recombination, and double-strand break repair through non-homologous end joining. However, ultra-small genomes such as Utricularia gibba (Bladderwort), which is 82 megabases (Mb), purge excess DNA through genome fractionation and neofunctionalization during multiple rounds of whole genome duplication (WGD). In contrast, the largest published genome, Picea abies (Norway Spruce) at 19 800 Mb, has no detectable WGD but has bloated with diverse and diverged LTRs that either have evaded purging mechanisms or these purging mechanism are absent in gymnosperms. Finally, advances in DNA methylation studies suggest that smaller genomes have a more aggressive epigenomic surveillance system to purge young LTR retrotransposons, which is less active or missing in larger genomes like the bloated gymnosperms. While genome size may not reflect genome complexity, evidence is mounting that genome size may reflect evolutionary status.",

Both methods point towards the involvement of ion channel genes and the transcription factors that govern their activity. A large fraction of disease- and trait-associated sequence variants lie within non-coding sequences, enriched with epigenetic marks indicative of regulatory DNA. Although sequence conservation as a result of functional constraint has been a useful property to identify transcriptional enhancers, this identification process has been advanced through the development of techniques such as ChIP-seq and chromatin conformation capture technologies. The role of variation in gene regulatory elements in the cardiac conduction system has recently been demonstrated by studies on enhancers of SCN5A / SCN10A and TBX5 . In both studies, a region harbouring a functionally implicated single-nucleotide polymorphism was shown to drive reproducible cardiac expression in a reporter gene assay. Furthermore, the risk variant of the allele abrogated enhancer function in both cases.

We include 240 actinobacteria classified into four pathogenicity classes: human pathogens (HPs), broad-spectrum pathogens (BPs), opportunistic pathogens (OPs) and non-pathogenic (NP). We hypothesize: (H1) Pathogens (HPs and BPs) possess specific pathogenicity signature genes. (H2) The same holds for OPs. (H3) Broad-spectrum and exclusively HPs cannot be distinguished from each other because of an observation bias, i.e. many HPs might yet be unclassified BPs. (H4) There is no intrinsic genomic characteristic of OPs compared with pathogens, as small mutations are likely to play a more dominant role to survive the immune system. To study these hypotheses, we implemented a bioinformatics pipeline that combines evolutionary sequence analysis with statistical learning methods (Random Forest with feature selection, model tuning and robustness analysis). Essentially, we present orthologous gene sets that computationally distinguish pathogens from NPs (H1). We further show a clear limit in differentiating OPs from both NPs (H2) and pathogens (H4). HPs may also not be distinguished from bacteria annotated as BPs based only on a small set of orthologous genes (H3), as many HPs might as well target a broad range of mammals but have not been annotated accordingly.

Linkage analysis requires genome-wide genotyping on family-based data, and traditionally the linkage analysis was performed before the targeting sequencing stage. However, methods are emerging that seek to exploit the capability of linkage analysis to integrate data both across individuals and across pedigrees. This ability has been exploited to select samples used for sequencing studies and to identify among the variants uncovered by sequencing those mapping to regions likely to contain the gene of interest and, more generally, to improve variant detection.

In this process, it becomes evident that 80-96% of the genes (depending on the species) are still without verified function. A significant proportion of the genes with verified metabolic functions are assigned to secondary or extracellular metabolism, leaving only 2-4% of the annotated genes within primary metabolism.

However discontinuous stretches of heterochromatin are critical for variegated expression of contingency genes that mediate key pathogenic processes in malaria. These range from invasion of erythrocytes and antigenic variation to solute transport and growth adaptation in response to environmental changes. Despite lack of structure within euchromatin the nucleus maintains functional compartments that regulate expression of many genes at the nuclear periphery, particularly genes with clonally variant expression. The typical components of the chromatin regulatory machinery are present in P. falciparum; however, some of these appear to have evolved novel species-specific functions, e.g. the dynamic regulation of histone variants at virulence gene promoters. The parasite also appears to have repeatedly acquired chromatin regulatory proteins through lateral transfer from endosymbionts and from the host. P. falciparum chromatin regulators have been successfully targeted with multiple drugs in laboratory studies; hopefully their functional divergence from human counterparts will allow the development of parasite-specific inhibitors.",

These loci are typically dispersed throughout the genome, but in some teleost species a few of them might be located on a preferential pair of (sex) chromosomes. The PSD system has a much higher level of variation of SD genotypes both at the level of gametes and the sexual genotype of individuals, than that of the chromosomal sex determination systems. The early sexual development of zebrafish males is a complicated process, as they first develop a juvenile ovary, that later undergoes a transformation to give way to a testis. To date, three major developmental pathways were shown to be involved with gonad differentiation through the modulation of programmed cell death. In our opinion, there are more pathways participating in the regulation of zebrafish gonad differentiation/transformation.

Simultaneously, excessive accumulation of iron is toxic. Consequently, iron uptake is a highly controlled process. In most fungal species, siderophores play a central role in iron handling. Siderophores are small iron-specific chelators that can be secreted to scavenge environmental iron or bind intracellular iron with high affinity. A second high-affinity iron uptake mechanism is reductive iron assimilation (RIA). As shown in Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus nidulans, synthesis of siderophores in Aspergilli is predominantly under control of the transcription factors SreA and HapX, which are connected by a negative transcriptional feedback loop. Abolishing this fine-tuned regulation corroborates iron homeostasis, including heme biosynthesis, which could be biotechnologically of interest, e.g. the heterologous production of heme-dependent peroxidases. Aspergillus niger genome inspection identified orthologues of several genes relevant for RIA and siderophore metabolism, as well as sreA and hapX. Interestingly, genes related to synthesis of the common fungal extracellular siderophore triacetylfusarinine C were absent. Reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) confirmed the absence of triacetylfusarinine C, and demonstrated that the major secreted siderophores of A. niger are coprogen B and ferrichrome, which is also the dominant intracellular siderophore. In A. niger wild type grown under iron-replete conditions, the expression of genes involved in coprogen biosynthesis and RIA was low in the exponential growth phase but significantly induced during ascospore germination. Deletion of sreA in A. niger resulted in elevated iron uptake and increased cellular ferrichrome accumulation. Increased sensitivity toward phleomycin and high iron concentration reflected the toxic effects of excessive iron uptake. Moreover, SreA-deficiency resulted in increased accumulation of heme intermediates, but no significant increase in heme content. Together with the upregulation of several heme biosynthesis genes, these results reveal a complex heme regulatory mechanism.",

        "des": "Iron is an essential metal for many organisms, but the biologically relevant form of iron is scarce because of rapid oxidation resulting in low solubility. Simultaneously, excessive accumulation of iron is toxic. Consequently, iron uptake is a highly controlled process. In most fungal species, siderophores play a central role in iron handling. Siderophores are small iron-specific chelators that can be secreted to scavenge environmental iron or bind intracellular iron with high affinity. A second high-affinity iron uptake mechanism is reductive iron assimilation (RIA). As shown in Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus nidulans , synthesis of siderophores in Aspergilli is predominantly under control of the transcription factors SreA and HapX, which are connected by a negative transcriptional feedback loop. Abolishing this fine-tuned regulation corroborates iron homeostasis, including heme biosynthesis, which could be biotechnologically of interest, e.g. the heterologous production of heme-dependent peroxidases. Aspergillus niger genome inspection identified orthologues of several genes relevant for RIA and siderophore metabolism, as well as sreA and hapX . Interestingly, genes related to synthesis of the common fungal extracellular siderophore triacetylfusarinine C were absent. Reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) confirmed the absence of triacetylfusarinine C, and demonstrated that the major secreted siderophores of A. niger are coprogen B and ferrichrome, which is also the dominant intracellular siderophore. In A. niger wild type grown under iron-replete conditions, the expression of genes involved in coprogen biosynthesis and RIA was low in the exponential growth phase but significantly induced during ascospore germination. Deletion of sreA in A. niger resulted in elevated iron uptake and increased cellular ferrichrome accumulation. Increased sensitivity toward phleomycin and high iron concentration reflected the toxic effects of excessive iron uptake. Moreover, SreA-deficiency resulted in increased accumulation of heme intermediates, but no significant increase in heme content. Together with the upregulation of several heme biosynthesis genes, these results reveal a complex heme regulatory mechanism.",

Although most cancers have the potential to metastasize under appropriate conditions, PCa favors the skeleton as a primary site of metastasis, suggesting that the bone microenvironment is conducive to its growth. PCa metastasis proceeds through a complex series of molecular events that include angiogenesis at the site of the original tumor, local migration within the primary site, intravasation into the blood stream, survival within the circulation, extravasation of the tumor cells to the target organ and colonization of those cells within the new site. In turn, each one of these steps involves a complicated chain of events that utilize multiple proteinprotein interactions, protein signaling cascades and transcriptional changes. Despite the urgent need to improve current biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis and drug resistance, advances have been slow. Global gene expression methods such as gene microarrays and RNA sequencing enable the study of thousands of genes simultaneously and allow scientists to examine molecular pathways of cancer pathogenesis. In this review, we summarize the current literature that explored high-throughput transcriptome analysis toward the advancement of biomarker discovery for PCa. Novel biomarkers are strongly needed to enable more accurate detection of PCa, improve prediction of tumor aggressiveness and facilitate the discovery of new therapeutic targets for tailored medicine.

For example, the degradation of a nonsense harming -globin allele renders normal phenotypes. On the other hand, regulating NMD is also important in those cases when the produced aberrant protein is better than having no protein, as it has been shown for cystic fibrosis.

Moreover, the realization that most genes undergo alternative splicing has had a strong impact in the overall cell proteome and metabolism research fields and also in better appraising the fundamental role played by splicing defects in human disease. This robust growth of knowledge is due in particular to the development of new powerful technical tools that range from methodologies useful to focus on single events in extreme detail to microarray and high-throughput RNA sequencing approaches that aim at providing a global vision of splicing changes. Here, we will discuss how these techniques relate to each other in terms of their respective strengths and weaknesses.

We focus the review on proteinprotein interactions (PPIs), a subset of associations defined as physical contacts between proteins that occur by selective molecular docking in a particular biological context. We present such definition as opposed to other types of protein associations derived from regulatory, genetic, structural or functional relations. To determine PPIs, a variety of binary and co-complex methods exist; however, not all the technologies provide the same information and data quality. A way of increasing confidence in a given protein interaction is to integrate orthogonal experimental evidences. The use of several complementary methods testing each single interaction assesses the accuracy of PPI data and tries to minimize the occurrence of false interactions. Following this approach there have been important efforts to unify primary databases of experimentally proven PPIs into integrated databases. These meta-databases provide a measure of the confidence of interactions based on the number of experimental proofs that report them. As a conclusion, we can state that integrated information allows the building of more reliable interaction networks.

Third, in silico analysis of CpGo/e ratios throughout the amphioxus genome suggests a bimodal distribution of DNA methylation, consistent with a mosaic pattern comprising domains of methylated DNA interspersed with domains of unmethylated DNA, similar to the situation described in ascidians, but radically different to the globally methylated vertebrate genomes.

In this review, I provide an overview of the recent developments in our understanding of the repertoire of RBPs across diverse model systems, and discuss the computational and experimental approaches currently available for the construction of posttranscriptional networks governed by them. I also present an overview of the different roles played by RBPs in the cellular context, based on their cis -regulatory modules identified in the literature and discuss how their interplay can result in the dynamic, spatial and tissue-specific expression maps of RNAs. I finally present the concept of posttranscriptional network of RBPs and their cognate RNA targets and discuss their cross-talk with other important posttranscriptional regulatory molecules such as microRNAs s, resulting in diverse functional network motifs.

Deuterostome invertebrates provide a view of immune repertoires in phyla that immediately predate the origins of vertebrates. Genomic studies in amphioxus, a cephalochordate, have revealed homologs of genes encoding most innate immune receptors found in vertebrates; however, many of the gene families have undergone dramatic expansions, greatly increasing the innate immune repertoire. In addition, domain-swapping accounts for the innovation of new predicted pathways of receptor function. In both amphioxus and Ciona , a urochordate, the VCBPs (variable region containing chitin-binding proteins), which consist of immunoglobulin V (variable) and chitin binding domains, mediate recognition through the V domains. The V domains of VCBPs in amphioxus exhibit high levels of allelic complexity that presumably relate to functional specificity. Various features of the amphioxus immune repertoire reflect novel selective pressures, which likely have resulted in innovative strategies.

In this review, we are summarizing our current understanding of the NR diversity in the cephalochordate amphioxus, which represents the best available proxy for the last common chordate ancestor both in terms of morphology and genome organization. The amphioxus genome encodes 33 NRs, which is more than expected based on its phylogenetic position, with at least one representative of all major NR groups, excepting NR1E and NR1I/J. This elevated number of receptor genes shows that the amphioxus NR complement has experienced some secondary modifications that are most evident in the NR1H group, which is characterized by three members in humans and ten representatives in amphioxus. By highlighting specific examples of the NR repertoire, including the receptors for retinoic acid, thyroid hormone, estrogen and steroids as well as the bile acid and oxysterol receptors of the NR1H group, we are illustrating the functional diversity of these receptors in amphioxus.

Questions, and partial answers thereof, such as how the connectivity between molecular parts translates into the relationships between the related disorders on a global scale and how central the disease-causing genetic components are in the cellular network, will be discussed. The use of the diseasome in combination with various interactome networks and other disease-related factors is also reviewed.",

Comparative genome studies of vertebrates and amphioxus have uncovered clear evidence supporting the hypothesis of two-round whole-genome duplication thought to have occurred early in vertebrate evolution and have shed light on the evolution of morphological novelties in the complex vertebrate body plan. Complementary to the amphioxus genome-sequencing project, a large collection of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) has been generated for amphioxus in recent years; this valuable collection represents a rich resource for gene discovery, expression profiling and molecular developmental studies in the amphioxus model.

One approach to accomplish this goal is the genome-driven cell engineering approach, which searches for functioning minimal genomes in naturally occurring microorganisms, which can then be used as a template for future systems. Currently a prototypical minimal genome has not been discovered. This review analyzes the organisms Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Pelagibacter ubique, Vesicomyosocius okutanii and Prochlorococcus marinus as models of heterotrophic symbiont, heterotrophic free-living, autotrophic symbiont and autotrophic free-living organisms respectively and compares them to the current minimal cell model in order to determine which most closely resembles a true minimal genome. M. pneumoniae possesses a genome of 816 394 base pairs (bp) with 688 open reading frames (ORF) and a severely limited metabolism. Pelagibacter ubique possesses a 1 308 000 bp genome with 1354 ORF and has a fully functional metabolism but requires a reduced form of sulphur.

Large-scale projects are now underway to catalog the complete phenome of a species, notably the mouse. With the increasing amount of phenotype information becoming available, a major challenge that biology faces today is the systematic analysis of this information and the translation of research results across species and into an improved understanding of human disease. The challenge is to integrate and combine phenotype descriptions within a species and to systematically relate them to phenotype descriptions in other species, in order to form a comprehensive understanding of the relations between those phenotypes and the genotypes involved in human disease. We distinguish between two major approaches for comparative phenotype analyses: the first relies on evolutionary relations to bridge the species gap, while the other approach compares phenotypes directly. In particular, the direct comparison of phenotypes relies heavily on the quality and coherence of phenotype and disease databases. We discuss major achievements and future challenges for these databases in light of their potential to contribute to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying human disease.

In this study, we investigated the extent to which off-targets may occur in Drosophila melanogaster by looking at mature mRNA sequences and pre-mature RNA sequences separately. First, an in silico approach revealed that, based on sequence similarity, numerous off-targets are predicted to occur in RNAi experiments.

Significantly, increase in genomic complexity has been correlated with increase in repetitive content of the genome. Primate-specific Alu repeats, belonging to SINE class of repeats, is the most abundant repeat class inhabiting the human genome. Of the many possible functional roles of Alu repeats, they have been shown to modulate human transcriptome by virtue of harboring diverse array of functional RNA pol II TFBS, cryptic splice-site-mediated Alu exonization and as probable miRNA targets. Retro-transposition of Alu harboring TFBS has shaped up gene-specific regulatory networks. Alu exonized transcripts are raw material for dsRNA-mediated AI editing leading to nuclear retention of transcripts and change in miRNA target. miRNA targets within Alu may titrate the effective miRNA or transcript concentration, thus acting as miRNA sponge. Differential levels of Alu RNA during different conditions of stress also await clear functional understanding. These have contributed toward evolution of complex regulatory repertoire leading to the evolution of primate-specific functions. Recent reports of co-localization of pol II and pol III binding sites near the gene and elsewhere in the genome, increase the possibility of dynamic co-ordination between both pol II and pol III determining the ultimate transcriptional outcome.

With the generalization of this principle, new questions emerge, such as how the close contacts are formed and stabilized and, importantly, how they contribute to the regulation of transcriptional output at target genes. This review will concentrate on examples where a functional role and a mechanistic understanding has been explored for loops formed between genes and their regulatory elements or among the elements themselves.",

Here we illustrate our own attempts to apply functional genomics and genetical genomics approaches in order to identify functional networks of genes relevant to traits related to meat performance. Expression data of 74 M longissimus dorsi samples obtained using Affymetrix GeneChips were correlated with drip loss and principal components (PCs) with high loadings of meat quality traits. Functional annotation analyses revealed that differences in water holding capacity, early pH decline and ultimate pH were related to the ubiquitin-proteasome system, mitochondrial metabolic pathways and muscle structural aspects. In particular, 1279 genes were correlated with drip loss ( P &le; 0.001; q &le; 0.004). Negatively correlated transcripts were enriched in functional categories like extracellular matrix receptor interaction and Ca-signalling. Transcripts with a positive correlation represented oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial pathways and transporter activity.

We propose to adapt the approaches defined for the analysis of gene-expression microarray in order to infer information in metagenomics.

The data contain two different diets (high-fat or normal-chow) to ensure the onset of obesity, prodrome of metabolic syndromes (MS). By using 16S rRNA gene as a genomic diversity marker, we illustrate how this approach can identify bacterial populations differentially enriched among different genetic and dietary conditions of the host. This approach faithfully reproduces highly-relevant results from phylogenetic and standard statistical analyses, used to explain the role of the gut microbiome in relation to obesity.

A full understanding of the factors that orchestrate gene expression will be essential to fully understand evolutionary variety. Transcription factor (TF) proteins, which form gene regulatory networks (GRNs) to act in cooperative or competitive partnerships to regulate gene expression, are key components of these unique regulatory programs. Although many TFs are conserved in structure and function, certain classes of TFs display extensive levels of species diversity. In this review, we highlight families of TFs that have expanded through gene duplication events to create species-unique repertoires in different evolutionary lineages. We discuss how the hierarchical structures of GRNs allow for flexible small to large-scale phenotypic changes. We survey evidence that explains how newly evolved TFs may be integrated into an existing GRN and how molecular changes in TFs might impact the GRNs.

The highly packaged paternal chromatin delivered by the sperm is decondensed and acquires a number of specific epigenetic marks, but markedly remains devoid of those usually associated with constitutive heterochromatin. During this period the maternal chromatin remains relatively stable except for marks associated with transcription and/or replication such as arginine methylation and H3/H4 acetylation. The embryo then undergoes a series of mitotic divisions without significant additional growth but differentiation, resulting in the formation of a blastocyst containing distinct cell types. The chromatin remodelling events during these stages are likely to be important in establishing the nuclear foundations required for later triggers of differentiation. Overall, we summarize three important points during these earliest reprogramming events: (i) relatively stable maternal chromatin after fertilization, (ii) rapid acquisition of specific histone marks by the paternal chromatin during the hours that follow fertilization and (iii) rapid remodelling of constitutive heterochromatic marks and modifications in the core of the nucleosome from the first mitotic division.

The surge of interest in association mapping has been fueled by recent developments in genomics that allows for rapid identification and scoring of genetic markers which has traditionally limited mapping experiments. With the decreasing cost of genotyping future emphasis will likely focus on phenotyping, which can be both costly and time consuming but which is crucial for obtaining reliable results in association mapping studies. In addition, association mapping studies are prone to the identification of false positives, especially if the experimental design is not rigorously controlled. For example, population structure has long been known to induce many false positives and accounting for population structure has become one of the main issues when implementing association mapping in plants. Also, with increasing numbers of genetic markers used, the problem becomes separating true from false positive and this highlights the need for independent validation of identified association.

This toolbox includes the near completion of the pig genome, catalogues of genes and genetic variation in pigs, extensive characterization of pig proteomes and transcriptomes, as well as the development of transgenic disease models. The aim of this review is to highlight the current progress of these ongoing areas of research, which are mandatory for successful development of biomedical pig models that are in demand for understanding human biology in health and disease.

Homozygosity for LP is also associated with congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB) in Appaloosa horses. Previously, LP was mapped to a 6 cm region on ECA1 containing the candidate gene TRPM1 ( Transient Receptor Potential Cation Channel, Subfamily M, Member 1 ) and decreased expression of this gene, measured by qRT&ndash;PCR, was identified as the likely cause of both spotting and ocular phenotypes. This study describes investigations for a mutation causing or associated with the Leopard Complex and CSNB phenotype in horses. Re-sequencing of the gene and associated splice sites within the 105 624 bp genomic region of TRPM1 led to the discovery of 18 SNPs. Most of the SNPs did not have a predictive value for the presence of LP . However, one SNP (ECA1:108,249,293 C>T) found within intron 11 had a strong ( P < 0.0005), but not complete, association with LP and CSNB and thus is a good marker but unlikely to be causative. To further localize the association, 70 SNPs spanning over two Mb including the TRPM1 gene were genotyped in 192 horses from three different breeds segregating for LP. A single 173 kb haplotype associated with LP and CSNB (ECA1: 108,197,355- 108,370,150) was identified. Illumina sequencing of 300 kb surrounding this haplotype revealed 57 SNP variants. Based on their localization within expressed sequences or regions of high sequence conservation across mammals, six of these SNPs were considered to be the most likely candidate mutations. While the precise function of TRPM1 remains to be elucidated, this work solidifies its functional role in both pigmentation and night vision. Further, this work has identified several potential regulatory elements of the TRPM1 gene that should be investigated further in this and other species.",

Paternal mRNA levels are probably reduced as the result of transcriptional interference of the regular promoter and the alternative promoter on this chromosome. CpG 85 is part of a truncated processed pseudogene ( KIAA0649P ) that integrated into the RB1 gene prior to the speciation of extant primates. It is plausible that differential penetrance and variation of age at diagnosis, which have been observed in patients with hereditary and non-hereditary retinoblastoma, respectively, are a consequence of imprinted expression of the RB1 gene.

Imprinted expression of RB1 is linked to a differentially methylated CpG island in intron 2 of this gene (CpG 85). On the paternal chromosome, CpG 85 is unmethylated and acts as a weak promoter of an alternative RB1 transcript. Paternal mRNA levels are probably reduced as the result of transcriptional interference of the regular promoter and the alternative promoter on this chromosome. CpG 85 is part of a truncated processed pseudogene (KIAA0649P) that integrated into the RB1 gene prior to the speciation of extant primates. It is plausible that differential penetrance and variation of age at diagnosis, which have been observed in patients with hereditary and non-hereditary retinoblastoma, respectively, are a consequence of imprinted expression of the RB1 gene. Interestingly, RB1 is imprinted in the same direction as CDKN1C, which operates upstream of RB1. The imprinting of two components of the same pathway indicates that there has been strong evolutionary selection for maternal inhibition of cell proliferation.",

This review analyzes the organisms Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Pelagibacter ubique, Vesicomyosocius okutanii and Prochlorococcus marinus as models of heterotrophic symbiont, heterotrophic free-living, autotrophic symbiont and autotrophic free-living organisms respectively and compares them to the current minimal cell model in order to determine which most closely resembles a true minimal genome. M. pneumoniae possesses a genome of 816 394 base pairs (bp) with 688 open reading frames (ORF) and a severely limited metabolism. Pelagibacter ubique possesses a 1 308 000 bp genome with 1354 ORF and has a fully functional metabolism but requires a reduced form of sulphur. Vesicomyosocius okutanii possesses a 1 020 000 bp genome with 975 ORF and is deficient in the production of threonine, isoleucine and ubiquinone. Prochlorococcus marinus possesses a 1 751 080 bp genome with 1884 ORF and has a complete metabolism with no deficiencies.

Primate-specific Alu repeats, belonging to SINE class of repeats, is the most abundant repeat class inhabiting the human genome. Of the many possible functional roles of Alu repeats, they have been shown to modulate human transcriptome by virtue of harboring diverse array of functional RNA pol II TFBS, cryptic splice-site-mediated Alu exonization and as probable miRNA targets. Retro-transposition of Alu harboring TFBS has shaped up gene-specific regulatory networks. Alu exonized transcripts are raw material for dsRNA-mediated A-I editing leading to nuclear retention of transcripts and change in miRNA target. miRNA targets within Alu may titrate the effective miRNA or transcript concentration, thus acting as 'miRNA sponge'. Differential levels of Alu RNA during different conditions of stress also await clear functional understanding. These have contributed toward evolution of complex regulatory repertoire leading to the evolution of primate-specific functions. Recent reports of co-localization of pol II and pol III binding sites near the gene and elsewhere in the genome, increase the possibility of dynamic co-ordination between both pol II and pol III determining the ultimate transcriptional outcome.

On the linear chromatin template these elements can be located hundreds of kilobases away from their target gene and for a long time it was a mystery how these elements communicate. For example, in the [beta]-globin locus the main regulatory element, the Locus Control Region (LCR), is located up to 40-60 kb away from the [beta]-globin genes. Recently it was demonstrated that the LCR resides in close proximity to the active [beta]-globin genes while the intervening inactive chromatin loops out. Thus the chromatin fibre of the [beta]-globin locus adopts an erythroid-specific spatial organization referred to as the Active Chromatin Hub (ACH). This observation for the first time demonstrated a role for chromatin folding in transcriptional regulation. Since this first observation in the [beta]-globin locus, similar chromatin interactions between regulatory elements in several other gene loci have been observed. Chromatin loops also appear to be formed between promoters and 3'UTRs of genes and even trans-interactions between loci on different chromosomes have been reported. Although the occurrence of long-range chromatin contacts between regulatory elements is now firmly established it is still not clear how these long-range contacts are set up and how the transcriptional output of genes is modified by the proximity of cis-regulatory DNA elements.

The task of computational charting of regulatory inputs in the genome can be approached from several directions. Typically, computational identification of putative regulatory elements for a gene of interest requires tools that will aid in estimating the extent of the (potentially vast) genomic region around the gene that is likely to contain regulatory elements, as well as tools for the identification and characterization of individual elements. Conversely, starting from a putative regulatory element or a regulatory variation in a non-coding region, one often wants to associate the regulatory element with the correct target gene(s). The design of tools for these purposes relies on the remarkably high level of sequence conservation of thousands of regulatory enhancers, their strong tendency to cluster around their target genes, as well as a constrained range of functional categories of the corresponding target genes, many of which are developmental regulators. Additional evolutionary information, such as conservation of synteny, and a growing body of functional genomic and epigenomic data are being rapidly added to established and emerging tools for studying developmental regulation and cross-species conservation to provide new functional insights into the roles of these regions. In this article, we give an overview of the functionality available in general purpose and new/specialized web tools for the above tasks, and discuss current and future developments in the field.

One of the great challenges of the post-genome era is to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms of gene control. Proper gene regulation depends not only on the required transcription factors and associated complexes being present (in the correct dosage), but also on the integrity, chromatin conformation and nuclear positioning of the gene's chromosomal segment. Thus, when either the cis-trans regulatory system of a gene or the normal context of its chromatin structure are disrupted, gene expression may be adversely affected, potentially leading to disease. As transcriptional regulation is a highly complex process depending on many factors, there are many different mechanisms that can cause aberrant gene expression. Traditionally, the term 'position effect' was used to refer to situations where the level of expression of a gene is deleteriously affected by an alteration in its chromosomal environment, while maintaining an intact transcription unit. Over the past years, an ever increasing number of such disease-related position effect cases have come to light, and detailed studies have revealed insight into the variety of causes, which can be categorized into a number of different mechanistic groups. We suggest replacing the outdated term of 'position effect disease' with the new generic name of 'cis-ruption disorder' to describe genetic disease cases that are caused by disruption of the normal cis-regulatory architecture of the disease gene locus. Here, we review these various cis-ruption mechanisms and discuss how their studies have contributed to our understanding of long- range gene regulation. [PUBLICATION ]",

This surprising observation challenges many assumptions about the genetic programming of higher organisms and how information is stored and organized within the genome. Moreover, the rapid advances in genomics have given little opportunity for biologists to integrate these emerging findings into their intellectual and experimental frameworks. This problem has been compounded by the perception that genome-wide studies often generate more questions than answers, which in turn has led to confusion and controversy. In this article, we address common questions associated with the phenomenon of pervasive transcription and consider the indices that can be used to evaluate the function (or lack thereof) of the resulting ncRNAs. We suggest that many lines of evidence, including expression profiles, conservation signatures, chromatin modification patterns and examination of increasing numbers of individual cases, argue in favour of the widespread functionality of non-coding transcription. We also discuss how informatic and experimental approaches used to analyse protein-coding genes may not be applicable to ncRNAs and how the general perception that protein-coding genes form the main informational output of the genome has resulted in much of the misunderstanding surrounding pervasive transcription and its potential significance. Finally, we present the conceptual implications of the majority of the eukaryotic genome being functional and describe how appreciating this perspective will provide considerable opportunity to further understand the molecular basis of development and complex diseases.

Recently it has also become possible to generate expression data from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded archival samples. With the range of samples that can now be successfully profiled by microarray analysis this should be a good time to be running a microarray core facility.

Currently there are simply not enough Next Generation Sequencers in operation to meet the level of demand for expression profiling that microarray facilities service, but more systems are constantly becoming available.

Moreover, novel prognostically relevant gene classifiers were developed as, for example, in normal karyotype AML. Considering the lymphatic malignancies, GEP studies defined novel clinically relevant subtypes in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and improved the discrimination of Burkitt lymphoma and DLBCL cases, overcoming considerable overlaps of these entities that exist from morphological and genetic perspectives.

Instead, it is not unusual to find genes expressed in different cell types, or in different developmental stages, sharing a particular region of a chromosome. Therefore, the existence of boundaries, or insulators, as non-coding gene regulatory elements, is instrumental for the adequate organization and function of vertebrate genomes. Through the evolution and natural selection at the molecular level, and according to available DNA sequences surrounding a locus, previously existing or recently mobilized, different elements have been recruited to serve as boundaries, depending on their suitability to properly insulate gene expression domains. In this regard, several gene regulatory elements, including scaffold/matrix-attachment regions, members of families of DNA repetitive elements (such as LINEs or SINEs), target sites for the zinc-finger multipurpose nuclear factor CTCF, enhancers and locus control regions, have been reported to show functional activities as insulators. In this review, we will address how such a variety of apparently different genomic sequences converge in a similar function, namely, to adequately insulate a gene expression domain, thereby allowing the locus to be expressed according to their own gene regulatory elements without interfering itself and being interfered by surrounding loci.

Research in this field has greatly profited from recent developments in novel sequencing technologies that allow massive parallel sequencing of small RNA (sRNA) molecules, the key players of all RNA silencing phenomena. As researchers are beginning to decipher the complexity of RNA silencing, novel methodologies have to be developed to make sense of the large amounts of data that are currently being generated. In this review we present an overview of RNA silencing pathways in plants and the current challenges in analysing sRNA data, with a special focus on computational approaches. [PUBLICATION ]",

As with most solid cancers, the cure rate for SCCHN is excellent if tumors are diagnosed early in the course of the disease. Early diagnosis of cancer remains difficult because of the lack of specific symptoms in early disease as well as the limited understanding of etiology and oncogenesis. Advances in proteomics and genomics contribute to the understanding of the pathophysiology of neoplasia, cancer diagnosis and anticancer drug discovery. The powerful 'omics' technologies have opened new avenues towards biomarker discovery, identification of signaling molecules associated with cell growth, cell death, cellular metabolism and early detection of cancer. Analysis of tumor-specific omics profiles provided a unique opportunity to diagnose, classify, and detect malignant disease; to better understand and define the behavior of specific tumors; and to provide direct and targeted therapy. These technologies however still require integration and standardization of techniques and validation against accepted clinical and pathologic parameters.

In this review, we discuss how the Dorsal gradient controls the dorsal-ventral patterning of the early Drosophila embryo. This gradient extends from the ventral midline of the embryo into dorso-lateral regions, encompassing a cross-sectional field of approximately 20 cells. There is no evidence that these cells acquire distinctive identities due to subtle changes in the nuclear concentrations of the Dorsal protein. Rather, a variety of evidence suggests that the Dorsal gradient generates just three primary thresholds of gene activity. High levels activate gene expression in the presumptive mesoderm, while intermediate and low levels activate gene expression in the ventral and dorsal neurogenic ectoderm, respectively. We discuss how these primary readouts of the gradient establish localized domains of cell signalling, which work in a combinatorial manner with transcriptional networks to produce complex patterns of gene expression and tissue differentiation.

This raises the question whether short open reading frames might also have a functional potential in other mRNAs, in particular those that occur in the 5[variant prime]-UTR of many mRNAs. A number of these have been shown to act in cis to regulate the translation of the main open reading frame of the mRNA. But there may be others that could act in trans on other biological processes.

Based on increasingly accurate gene counts in other species, it now appears that C. elegans has more functional genes than most insects and approximately the same number as most mammals. In the last few years, draft genome sequences for several other nematodes have been published (C. briggsae and Brugia malayi) or publicly released (C. remanei, C. brenneri, C. japonica, Pristionchus pacificus, Trichinella spiralis and Haemonchus contortus). Comparisons of gene content within the phylum and to other phyla reveal complex patterns of genome evolution. These patterns include substantial numbers of genes conserved across all the major metazoan phyla (core metazoan genes) and many nematode-specific genes and gene families. Nematode-specific genes are located predominantly on autosomal arms, which also have higher recombination rates. It appears that evolutionary innovations occur mostly in these regions, probably facilitated by higher recombination. Few of these genes have gross phenotypes when knocked down by RNAi, suggesting that many of them function in specific aspects of nematode biology that were not tested, including chemosensation, pathogen response and xenobiotic detoxification.

Events such as final maturation of gametes, gamete transport, fertilization, early embryonic development and development of foetus to term, are all dependant upon the relay of appropriate molecular signals between the mother, gametes and embryos. This signalling is temporally and spatially regulated, involving complex interactions. Disturbances in maternal communication with gametes and embryos can influence the outcome of pregnancy. Effects range from those that are immediately obvious, such as spontaneous miscarriage (due to inappropriate hormonal signalling), to more subtle consequences that may not become apparent until offspring reach adulthood ('foetal origins' hypothesis). Current knowledge of the factors and mechanisms involved in maternal communication with gametes and embryos is limited to only a few individual pathways. There is a need for a holistic view of all actions and interactions taking place during this crosstalk between the gametes, embryos and the female reproductive tract. Applying high-throughput genomic and proteomic analysis tools and systems biology approaches, together with mathematical modelling would allow construction of an in silico model for the temporal sequence of events involved.

Extensive behaviour-based chemical screens would likely identify novel psychiatric drugs. However, large-scale chemical screens in mammals are inefficient and impractical. In contrast, zebrafish are very well suited for high-throughput behaviour-based drug discovery. Furthermore, the vast amounts of data generated from large-scale behavioural screens in zebrafish will facilitate a systems-level analysis of how chemicals affect behaviour. Unlike serendipitous discoveries in mammals, a comprehensive and integrative analysis of zebrafish chemobehavioural phenomics may identify functional relationships that would be missed by more reductionist approaches.

This applies to scientists investigating fundamental pathways in model organisms, but also to clinicians trying to understand human disease. There are many different types of experimental data that can be used to predict the genes that are important for a process, but these data are normally dispersed across numerous publications and databases, and are of varying and unknown quality. Integrated functional gene networks aim to gather functional information from all of these data into a single intuitive graph model that can be used to predict gene functions. In this approach, the ability of each data set to predict functional associations between genes is first measured using a standard benchmark, and then the scored predictions by each data set are combined. The resulting integrated probabilistic gene network can be used by all researchers to predict gene function, with much greater coverage and accuracy than any individual data set. In this review, we discuss how such integrated gene networks are constructed, how their predictive power for gene function can be tested, and how experimental biologists can use these networks to guide their research. We pay particular attention to such networks constructed for Caenorhabditis elegans, because in this complex multicellular model system functional predictions for genes can be rapidly tested in vivo using RNAi.

The interpretation of results of some such studies can be erroneous if normal cells and cancer cells are cultured in serum-free medium (SFM) and serum-supplemented media, respectively as recommended for their optimal growth.

Reverse genetic tools are available, although it is more challenging and time-consuming to identify mutations in specific genes of interest and virtually impossible to induce mutations in a targeted manner. Two recent papers have shown that locus-specific zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) can be used to create mutations in investigator-specified loci at high frequency, generating considerable enthusiasm that the technology may be generally applicable to many zebrafish genes. The rate-limiting step in ZFN application is typically the zinc-finger protein (ZFP) design phase, partly because ZFPs that bind to intended target sequences in naked DNA may not recognize the target within chromatin, or may recognize cryptic sites. Importantly, both papers also provide new tools to validate or pre-select ZFNs that work well in vivo and thus greatly facilitate the identification of active ZFNs. Finally, work in other model systems and in cultured cells show that ZFNs can facilitate homology-directed repair, raising the exciting possibility that ZFNs may facilitate homologous recombination in zebrafish, allowing site-specific modification of endogenous genes via a method that does not require embryonic stem cell technology.

Recent studies suggest that cell type-specific gene silencing in vivo can be achieved by combining siRNAs with cell type-specific affinity ligands such as monoclonal antibodies. The antibody-directed siRNA complex enters target cells through receptor endocytosis and is subsequently released to the cytosol to specifically silence target gene expression through biologically conserved RNA interference (RNAi) pathways. Antibody fragments fused with a small basic nucleic-acid-binding protein and antibody fragment-directed nanoimmunoliposomes are two examples of effective delivery vehicles in vivo. The demonstrated specificity of in vivo gene silencing and the lack of nonspecific immune activation and systemic toxicity encourage further development of therapies based on cell type-specific delivery of siRNA.

These stresses are becoming increasingly important because of the declining availability of good quality water, land degradation and community pressures to move away from chemical intervention in agriculture. Of the major cereals, wheat and barley are grown in the most hostile and consequently lowest yielding environments. Extensive genetic studies and surveys of landrace and wild germplasm have indicated extensive variation for abiotic stress tolerance but this has been difficult to exploit due to the relatively poor background knowledge of the molecular basis for stress in these species. Interconnected signal transduction pathways that lead to multiple responses to abiotic stresses have been difficult to study using traditional approaches because of their complexity and the large number of genes and gene products involved in the various defensive and developmental responses of the plant. Functional genomics is now widely seen as providing tools for dissecting abiotic stress responses in wheat and barley, through which networks of stress perception, signal transduction and defensive responses can be examined from gene transcription, through protein complements of cells, to the metabolite profiles of stressed tissues.",

This study assesses progress in cyanobacterial shotgun proteomics to date, and adds a new perspective by developing a protocol for the shotgun proteomic analysis of the filamentous cyanobacterium Anabaena variabilis ATCC 29413, a model for N 2 fixation. Using approaches for enhanced protein extraction, 646 proteins were identified, which is more than double the previous results obtained using 2DE. Notably, the improved extraction method and shotgun approach resulted in a significantly higher representation of basic and hydrophobic proteins. The use of protein bioinformatics tools to further mine these shotgun data is illustrated through the application of PSORTb for localization, the grand average hydropathy (GRAVY) index for hydrophobicity, LipoP for lipoproteins and the exponentially modified protein abundance index (emPAI) for abundance.

The organization of chromatin is considered to be regulated by a variety of post-translational modifications of histones, such as acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, SUMOylation and poly-ADP-ribosylation. The relationship between histone acetylation and gene expression was first observed in 1964. Since then, a great deal of evidence has accumulated showing that not only transcription but other DNA-mediated reactions also are regulated by histone acetylation. With regard to the putative mechanism(s) by which histone acetylation regulates the flow of genetic information, site-specific modification and recognition of acetylated histone/DNA complexes have been postulated. Elucidation of the downstream effects of histone modification, as well as the identification, isolation and characterization of the relevant factors involved, have aided in our understanding of the mechanisms of regulation of DNA activity by histones.

Peptide sequences were identified with BioWorks 3.1 and sequence coverage calculated for the 38 most confidently identified proteins. Trypsin and GluC yielded greater coverage than chymotrypsin, while ArgC had the least sequence coverage. Protein sequence coverage was affected only slightly over four orders of magnitude dynamic range of abundance. Combining the peptides derived from different proteases further increased the coverage. Maximal sequence coverage was achieved by combining digest results from both GluC and trypsin. These results have implications for future studies to identify CSF proteins and their post-translational modifications.",

Based on such observations, experiments have been designed to investigate the determinism of these differences at the molecular level, and a few genes that play a major role in the innate mechanisms of defence of the species toward viral aggressions have been characterised. For example, the extraordinary resistance of SJL mice to experimental infections with hepatitis virus strain A59 is the consequence of a structural alteration of a cell adhesion molecule which normally binds to the spikes of the virus, allowing its entry into the cells. If the virus cannot bind to the molecule, or if the molecule is absent, epithelial cells of the intestine and liver are not infected and mice are resistant. In the same way, most - not to say all - laboratory strains of mice are susceptible to infections with orthomyxoviruses or flaviviruses because essential molecules, the synthesis of which is normally triggered by interferon, are defective in these mice. Wild mice, by contrast - probably because they are constantly exposed to natural infections - are resistant. Finally, some mouse strains resist experimental infections by the mouse cytomegalovirus 1 (MCMV-1) because, once infected, these mice synthesise a molecule at the surface of infected cells which allows immediate recognition and killing by natural killer (NK) cells. With the exuberant development of mouse genetics and the constant generation of new mutant alleles, it is likely that many more genes with an impact on the phenotype of resistance or susceptibility will be identified in the forthcoming years.

It has recently emerged that innate resistance to mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection depends upon a large number of host genes with non-redundant functions; hence, random germline mutagenesis frequently causes susceptibility to this pathogen. Approximately one in 30 pedigrees derived from N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-mutagenised progenitors bears a recessive mutation that disrupts resistance to MCMV. Moreover, many of the genes required for resistance to MCMV will undoubtedly prove to have broad roles in immunity, creating resistance to many other microbes. The forward genetics approach offers an excellent opportunity to identify many of the key components of the innate immune system.",

In proliferating cells, and particularly during development, patterns of gene expression must be preserved in cells that have active DNA repair mechanisms and efficiently duplicate both DNA and the associated chromatin status-the histone code. The systems that regulate DNA synthesis and genome stability are integrated with those that regulate the efficacy of RNA synthesis, such that patterns of gene expression are maintained.

Because of the number of candidate genes involved, the number of alternative splice variants of individual genes and the number of pathways in which these genes function, a pathway analysis approach will be critical to success.

Markers for map building have generally depended on labour-intensive screening procedures, but in recent years this has changed with the availability of almost 500,000 chicken expressed sequence tags (ESTs). These resources and tools will be critical in the coming months when the chicken genome sequence is being assembled (eg cross-checked with other maps) and annotated (eg gene structures based on ESTs). The future for chicken genome and biological research is an exciting one, through the integration of these resources. For example, through the proposed chicken Ensembl database, it will be possible to solve challenging scientific questions by exploiting the power of a chicken model. One area of interest is the study of developmental mechanisms and the discovery of regulatory networks throughout the genome. Another is the study of the molecular nature of quantitative genetic variation.

The signals are usually restricted to relatively short regions of the 3'UTR, but their precise nature varies, with both sequence and structure playing key roles. Repeat motifs and functional redundancy also appear as common features of these signals.

By contrast, the genes of eukaryotes are generally considered to be monocistronic, each with its own promoter at the 5' end and a transcription terminator at the 3' end; however, it has recently become clear that not all eukaryotic genes are transcribed monocistronically. Numerous instances of polycistronic transcription in eukaryotes, from protists to chordates, have been reported. These can be divided into two broad types. Dicistronic transcription units specify a messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding two separate genes that is transported to the cytoplasm and translated in that form. Presumably, internal ribosome entry sites (IRES), or some form of translational re-initiation following the stop codon, are responsible for allowing translation of the downstream gene. In the other type, the initial transcript is processed by 3' end cleavage and trans-splicing to create monocistronic mRNAs that are transported to the cytoplasm and translated.

What do networks tell us? Some see in networks simply the comprehensive, detailed description of all cellular pathways, others seek in networks simple, higher-order qualities that emerge from the collective action of the individual pathways. This paper discusses networks from an encompassing category of thinking that will hopefully help readers to bridge the gap between these polarised viewpoints. Systems biology so far has emphasised the characterisation of large pathway maps. Now one has to ask: where is the actual biology in 'systems biology'? As structures midway between genome and phenome, and by serving as an 'extended genotype' or an 'elementary phenotype', molecular networks open a new window to the study of evolution and gene function in complex living systems. For the study of evolution, features in network topology offer a novel starting point for addressing the old debate on the relative contributions of natural selection versus intrinsic constraints to a particular trait. To study the function of genes, it is necessary not only to see them in the context of gene networks, but also to reach beyond describing network topology and to embrace the global dynamics of networks that will reveal higher-order, collective behaviour of the interacting genes. This will pave the way to understanding how the complexity of genomewide molecular networks collapses to produce a robust whole-cell behaviour that manifests as tightly-regulated switching between distinct cell fates - the basis for multicellular life.",

In this approach, peptides are separated by LC and, as they elute from the column, they are introduced into the gas phase and ionised by electrospray ionisation. The beam of ions is accumulated in an ion trap and then the concentrated ion packet is injected into a drift tube where the ions are separated again in the gas phase by IMS, a technique that differentiates ions based on their mobilities through a buffer gas. As ions exit the drift tube, they can be subjected to collisional activation to produce fragments prior to being introduced into a mass spectrometer for detection. The IMS separation can be carried out in only a few milliseconds and offers a number of advantages compared with LC-MS alone.

This eukaryotic display system enables presentation of large complex proteins on the surface of baculovirus particles and has thereby become a versatile system in molecular biology. Surface display strategies play an important role, as they may be used to enhance the efficiency and specificity of viral binding and entry to mammalian cells. In addition, baculovirus surface display vectors have been engineered to contain mammalian promoter elements designed for gene delivery both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, baculovirus capsid display has recently been developed; this holds promise for intracellular targeting of the viral capsid and subsequent cytosolic delivery of desired protein moieties.

The aim is to provide a resource for the experimental practitioner seeking awareness of the analytical tools that are now available in contemporary cancer research.",

P-element insertions are frequently used as starting-points for generating chromosomal deletions to remove flanking genes, either by screening for imprecise excision events or by selecting for male recombination events. Elements that utilise the yeast FLP/FLP recombination target (FRT) site-specific recombination system have been widely used to generate molecularly marked mitotic clones for mosaic analysis, extending the reach of this powerful genetic tool to virtually all areas of developmental biology. P-elements are still widely used as traditional mutagenesis reagents and form the backbone of projects aimed at generating insertions in every predicted gene in the fly genome. In addition, vectors based on the FLP/FRT system are being used for genome-wide applications, including the development of molecularly-mapped deletion and duplication kits. In addition to these 'traditional' genetic approaches, a variety of engineered elements have been developed for a wide range of transgenic applications, including enhancer trapping, gene-tagging, targeted misexpression, RNA interference (RNAi) delivery and homologous recombination/gene replacement. To complement the use of P-elements, alternative transposon vectors have been developed. The most widely used of these are the lepidopteran element piggyBac and a Drosophila hydei transposon, Minos. In total, a range of transposon vectors offers the Drosophila biologist considerable flexibility and sophistication in manipulating the genome of the fly and has allowed rapid advances in all areas of developmental biology and genome science.",

Here, we review the current state of large-scale gene expression analysis of human skin, with an emphasis on SAGE and complementary DNA microarrays.

This repeat maps within 30 kb of the 4q telomere. Although D4Z4 repeat units each contain an open reading frame that could encode a homeodomain protein, there is no evidence that the repeat is transcribed, and the underlying disease mechanism probably involves a position effect. A recent study has identified a protein complex bound to D4Z4 that contains YY1 and HMGB2, implicating a role for D4Z4 as a repressor. The 4q telomere has two variants, 4qA and 4qB. Although these alleles are present at almost equal frequencies in the general population, FSHD is associated only with the 4qA allele and never with 4qB. This suggests a functional difference between the telomere variants, either in predisposition to deletions within D4Z4 or in the pathological consequence of the deletion. Comparative mapping studies of the FSHD region in primates, mouse and Fugu rubripes have given insights into the evolutionary history of the D4Z4 repeat and of 4qter, although as yet they have not provided any solutions to the FSHD puzzle.",

Exploring the realm of these proteins has proved to be an intricate task, mainly due to their hydrophobic nature and low abundance. Furthermore, the level of purity achieved by classical methods of purification and cell fractionation is insufficient. These restrictions pose major limitations for gel electrophoresis or chromatography-based separation techniques as th preferred methodologies for high-throughput analysis. Mass spectrometry has alleviated most of the difficulties in the identification of proteins in general; however, the Achilles' heel is still the isolation and separation of membrane proteins. In order to circumvent these limitations, a high-throughput platform has been devised, whereby proteases are applied to whole intact living cells. The resulting peptide fragments are then analysed by liquid chromatologyfollowed by tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) technology to provide a detailed profile of proteins exposedon the surface of the plasma membrane. This kind of protein trimming offers the advantages that no prior manipulation or fractionation of the cell is required, contaminating proteins areremarkably reduced and the procedure is adequate for high-throughput purposes. This method, referred to as PROCEED (PROteome of Cell Exposed Extracellular Domains) is compatible with isotope labelling techniques which facilitate comparative protein expression studies. The methodology is extendable to all cell types including yeast and bacteria. Finally, the advantages and the limitations of PROCEED are discussed in view of other current technologies.",

The domain is the most abundant DNA-binding motif in the human genome and is a component of many key eukaryotic transcription factors involved in growth and development. Numerous structures now exist for this domain and its mode of action is known in a variety of zinc finger-DNA complexes. Application of this knowledge has led to the development of 'designer' transcription factors where zinc fingers have been engineered to bind desired DNA sequences. Recently, advances have been made in this field that potentially allow the targeting of any DNA site. Consideration of chromatin structure and the use of effector domains in these 'designer' transcription factors have made possible the regulation of a number of endogenous genes.

This is especially the case for microorganisms which possess less identifiable traits and are more easily influenced by environment. Therefore, technology that allows identification of species based on genotype is highly desirable. Whole genome sequencing can provide a sufficient amount of information and can be determinative for this purpose but is very impractical for routine use. Thus, a competent technology is needed that allows a reproducible reduction in the amount of information required about a whole genome, while still providing sufficiently accurate identification. It is almost imperative for such a technology to be of a high cost-performance and of easy handling. Universality and portability are also strongly desired. Based on these criteria, the current state of genome analysis technologies are reviewed. Among various methodologies discussed here, amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), genome profiling (GP) and microarrays are the subject of particular attention. As species identification is a base for most fields of biology including microbiology, ecology, epidemiology and for various biotechnologies, it is of paramount importance to establish a more efficient, easily handled and more objective methodology, in parallel with conventional phenotype-based methodologies. GP is currently considered to have the most optimal nature for identification of species since it can reproducibly reduce a huge amount of genome information to a manageable size by way of random polymerase chain reaction and can extract a sufficient amount of information for species identification from the DNA fragments thus profiled by temperature gradient gel electrophoresis. The potential ability of DNA microarrays for this purpose is also discussed and promises much for the future.",

        "des": "Genetic advances have made remarkable progress towards our understanding of body weight regulation. Much of our current knowledge has come from the cloning and characterisation of the genes responsible for obesity syndromes in the mouse, and the identification of homologous mutations causing rare forms of obesity in humans. Gene targeting experiments in mice have been instrumental in confirming the importance of many genes in the aetiology of obesity, and the existence of a fundamental physiological pathway that controls energy balance is becoming clear.The genetic determinants that underlie common forms of human obesity are largely polygenic, with most genes producing small effects. Thus, elucidating the many genetic determinants of obesity is a current challenge for modern geneticists. Despite the inherent difficulties, progress has been made through linkage/association studies and a genetic map of quantitative trait loci for human obesity is beginning to emerge.Obesity research is now very much in a transition period. Not so long ago, access to high throughput screening, as well as microarray and proteomic techniques, was prohibitively expensive and available only to the few. In recent years, these technologies have become more accessible to the larger scientific community and, in this paper, we will discuss how such technological advances are likely to drive the next wave of progress in obesity research. For example, large-scale mutagenesis screens in rodents coupled with high throughput screening are likely to emerge as important technologies for identifying genes previously unexpected to be involved in body weight regulation. Furthermore, applications of microarray and proteomic techniques will further refine our understanding of currently known peptides as well as identify novel pathways and molecules which are involved in energy homeostasis.",

RNA aptamers derived from in vitro selections (SELEX) are being used inside cells for at least four purposes: (1) to antagonise normal cellular proteins as a means of elucidating their biological roles; (2) as decoys to natural RNA-binding proteins to reveal their functions or those of structural elements within naturally occurring transcripts; (3) as regulatory modules to govern the expression of exogenous genes; and (4) to antagonise disease-related targets for potential biomedical applications. This paper summarises recent advances in each of these areas, the parameters that influence successful application and the potential for future developments. The use of aptamers in vivo may serve as a paradigm for understanding how some non-coding RNAs and other elements of the ribonome exert their influence on the intracellular proteome, and is thus becoming an important tool for modern cell and molecular biology.",

Treatment of cardiovascular disease is, in most cases, guided by evidence from well-controlled clinical trials. Given the solid scientific basis for the treatment of most cardiovascular diseases, it is common for patients with a given disease to be treated in essentially the same manner. Thus, the clinical trials have been very informative about treating large groups of patients with a given disease, but are slightly less informative about the treatment of individual patients. Pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics have the potential of taking the information derived from large clinical trials and further refining it to select the drugs with the greatest likelihood for benefit, and least likelihood for harm, in individual patients, based on their genetic make-up. In this paper, the current literature on cardiovascular pharmacogenetics is emphasised, and how the use of pharmacogenetic/pharmacogenomic information may be particularly useful in the future in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases is also highlighted.",

        "des": "Those pharmaceutical companies whose goal is to generate novel innovative drugs are faced with the challenge that only a fraction of the compounds tested in clinical trials eventually become a registered drug. This problem of attrition is compounded by the fact that the clinical trial or development stage is by far the most costly phase of bringing a new drug to market, consuming around 80 per cent of the total spend. Transgenic technology represents an attractive approach to reducing the attrition rate of compounds entering clinical trials by increasing the quality of the target and compound combinations making the transition from discovery into development. Transgenic technology can impact at many points in the discovery process, including target identification and target validation, and provides models designed to alert researchers early to potential problems with drug metabolism and toxicity, as well as providing better models for human diseases. In target identification, transgenic animals harbouring large DNA fragments can be used to narrow down genetic regions. Genetic studies often result in the identification of large genomic regions and one way to decrease the region size is to do complementation studies in transgenic animals using, for example, inserts from bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones. In target validation, transgenic animals can be used for in vivo validation of a specific target. Considerable efforts are being made to establish new, rapid and robust tools with general utility for in vivo validation, but, so far, only transgenic animals work reliably on a wide range of targets. Transgenic animals can also be used to generate better disease models. Predictive animal models to test new compounds and targets will significantly speed up the drug discovery process and, more importantly, increase the quality of the compounds taken further in the research and development process. Humanised transgenic animals harbouring the human target molecule can be used to understand the effect of a compound acting on the human target in vivo. Also, models mimicking human drug metabolism will provide a means of assessing the effect of human-specific metabolites and of understanding the pharmacokinetic properties of potential drugs. In toxicology studies, transgenic animals are providing more predictive models. A good example of this are those models routinely used to look for carcinogenicity associated with new compounds.",

It uses the principle of coupling individual nascent proteins (phenotypes) to their corresponding mRNA (genotypes), through the formation of stable protein-ribosome-mRNA (PRM) complexes. This permits the simultaneous isolation of a functional nascent protein, through affinity for a ligand, together with the encoding mRNA, which is then converted and amplified as DNA for further manipulation, including repeated cycles or protein expression. Ribosome display has a number of advantages over cell-based systems such as phage display; in particular, it can display very large libraries without the restriction of bacterial transformation. It is also suitable for generating toxic, proteolytically sensitive and unstable proteins, and allows the incorporation of modified amino acids at defined positions. In combination with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods, mutations can be introduced efficiently into the selected DNA pool in subsequent cycles, leading to continuous DNA diversification and protein selection (in vitro protein evolution). Both prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosome display systems have been developed and each has its own distinctive features.

Such a genesis of fertile adult \"iPS\" mice could revive the roguish temptation of banned human reproductive cloning currently doomed by the failure of human cell reprogramming by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). This major concern deals with a potential use of human iPS cells and contrasts with the fact that these cells stand as breakthrough ethical substitutes for current allogeneic human embryonic stem (ES) cells and planned patient-specific SCNT-ES cells. Indeed, unlike ES cells, iPS cells are generated without the need of an oocyte or a blastocyst and are therefore free of the human oocyte scarcity and embryo destruction problems. For patient-specific iPS cells, safety issues are thus the very limitation to the initiation of their bench-to-bedside translation. Full pluripotency is the first concern since it is the most stringent proof of an unbiased epigenetic reprogramming. Importantly, mouse tetraploid-complementing iPS cells have been shown to be few among the former deemed bona fide iPS cells and are thus expected to be instrumental in the identification of potential reprogramming caveats and of critical markers of the fully-pluripotent state. In this respect, hot-off-the-press data show that full pluripotency is correlated to the activity of the imprinted Dlk1-Dio3 multigenic region which is frequently aberrantly silenced in iPS cells. The stringency of the tetraploid complemention assay by mouse iPS cells is thus expected to translate soon into optimized protocols for the genesis/identification of fully-pluripotent human iPS cells. Such a full pluripotency is discussed in light of transgene-free reprogramming protocols aimed a clearing the second safety concern of iPS cell genesis: oncogenic hazards resulting from random integration of reprogramming transgenes into target-cell chromosomal DNA. In this respect, iPS cell genesis being the result of a transient gene therapy mechanism, the transient epigenetic gene therapy arm of our proposed universal stem cell gene therepy platform is presented together with concurrent approaches mediated by protein transduction, mRNA transfection and small molecules.",

For effective gene therapeutics against primary and metastatic lesions, a systemically injectable tumor-targeting Ad vector system must be developed. Systemic delivery of Ad, however, is hampered by immune response against Ad, short half-life in the circulation, liver uptake, and low accumulation at target disease sites. Modification of the Ad surface allows Ad to circulate in the bloodstream for a longer time, to be not targeted to the liver, and to passively accumulate in tumor sites via enhanced permeation and retention effects. The addition of affinity tags results in active targeting and high efficacy. Strategies including addition of polymer complexes, chemical modifications, and targeting moieties have been applied to develop systemically injectable Ad gene therapeutic carriers. More versatile designs of Ad hybrid complexes have been developed with inorganic nanoparticles, polymers, and lipids, making smart nanomedicine possible. Integration of viral and nonviral nanomaterials can substantially synergize both fields, creating a new concept of gene therapeutics.

The replacement of dopamine is the most straightforward strategy to improve motor performance in PD. Researchers have been developing gene therapy aimed at local production of dopamine via the introduction of dopamine-synthesizing enzyme genes into the putamen. Two phase I clinical studies have used recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors to transfer the aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) gene into the putamen to restore efficient conversion of orally administered L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-dopa). The initial results of these studies have not only confirmed the safety of AAV vectors, but have also demonstrated the alleviation of motor symptoms associated with PD. Interestingly motor performance in the \"off\" medication state was improved after gene therapy, suggesting long-term modulation of dopaminergic signals in the striatal neurons was induced by gene transfer. Gene delivery of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase I (GCH) in addition to AADC may help to avoid motor fluctuations associated with intermittent intake of L-dopa by continuously supplying dopamine in the putamen.

Human PS (hPS) cells are therefore considered promising sources for future cell replacement therapy. Embryonic stem (ES) cells are the major type of PS cells that are derived from blastocyst embryos. Germ cells from testis can also become PS cells when cultured for a long period with a combination of growth factors. Alternatively, differentiated somatic cells can also be converted to PS cells by the method called nuclear reprogramming. This includes somatic cell nuclear transfer where a somatic cell nucleus is injected into an enucleated oocyte giving rise to a reprogrammed PS cell, as well as the recently developed technique of reprogramming differentiated somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells by introducing defined transcription factors. Regardless of the sources and generation methods, PS cells share common epithelial structures and maintain tight cellular interactions. Although the molecular mechanisms that regulate self-renewal and pluripotency of PS cells have been extensively studied, the basic cellular interactions that govern how PS cells control cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions are still not fully understood. In addition, there are several obstacles in the current culture methods for hPS cells that need to be overcome in order to achieve the highest safety and consistency required for clinical applications. A Rho-mediated signaling axis has recently been determined to be the core machinery that integrates cellular interactions between PS cells. By chemically engineering this axis, hPS cells are able to self-renew under completely defined conditions while maintaining their multi-differentiation capacities. When combined with the rapid progress in research focusing on iPS cells, these studies on cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion in PS cells may not only contribute to further understanding PS cell biology, but also lead to the development of novel technologies enabling the derivation and growth of clinically relevant hPS cells for regenerative therapies.",

Our platform has a transient epigenetic arm directed at long-term transcriptional inactivation/activation of endogenous genes through the transient action of promoter-specific siRNAs or sense/antisense oligonucleotides, thereby opening an attractive avenue for hazard-free reprogramming of therapeutic iPS cells. Therefore, in addition to its obvious original applications such as long-term transcriptional silencing of autosomal-dominant mutant alleles, the transient epigenetic gene therapy arm could initiate the clinical iPS cell era whereby epigenetic reprogramming of patient somatic cells will not only drive regenerative medicine sensu stricto but also the other arms of our universal stem cell gene therapy platform. Both product and drive of our platform, such hazard-free iPS cells and their derivatives should accommodate all kinds of protocols including 1) long-term gene therapy mediated by endonuclease-boosted gene targeting (gene repair/alteration or targeted transgene integration) or cybridization (mtDNA transfer), and 2) transient regenerative gene therapy aimed at synergizing both regenerative cell therapy sensu stricto and long-term/epigenetic gene therapy through the magnification of the homing/regenerative/differentiative potential of therapeutic stem cells. Our approach is thus discussed 1) in light of emerging concurrent transgene-free reprogramming protocols that rely on protein transduction, small molecules or unintegrating vectors and 2) in terms of somatic cell genetic-like breakthrough in which somatic cells can be safely reprogrammed ex vivo into patient-specific pluripotent stem cells, amplified, engineered through standard/personalized protocols, subjected to potential clonal selections and lineage commitments, and then returned to the patient, thereby driving effective therapeutic repopulative/regenerative dynamics into relevant niches (long-term engraftment) and tissues (basic and regenerative cell turn-over).",

The key to solving this problem lies on the observation made over 40 years ago that tumors are heterogeneous and thus might be maintained only by a rare subset of cells called \"cancer stem cells\" (CSCs). However, the proof of this principle was only possible after the development of modern research tools for investigating the behavior of defined cell populations in vivo. The blood-related cancer leukemia was the first disease where human CSCs, or leukemic stem cells (LSCs), were isolated. The development of quantitative xenotransplantation assays using immune-deficient mouse recipients to detect primitive human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) with in vivo repopulating ability and the adaptation of this model to leukemia have been instrumental. Leukemia can now be viewed as aberrant hematopoietic processes initiated by rare LSCs that have maintained or reacquired the capacity for indefinite proliferation through accumulated mutations and/or epigenetic changes. Yet, despite their critical importance, much remains to be learned about the developmental origin of LSC and the mechanisms responsible for their emergence in the course of the disease. This report will review our current knowledge on normal and leukemic stem cell development and finally demonstrate how these discoveries provide a paradigm for identification of CSCs from solid tumors.

Several technologies have been applied to the goal of achieving integration, including viruses and transposases. While these techniques are effective at some level, they each have drawbacks that can be improved upon. A novel integration system based on a phage integrase can address some of the previous limitations. The integrase from the Streptomyces bacteriophage phi C31 catalyzes site-specific, unidirectional integration into the genomes of higher eukaryotes. This integrase has the ability to recognize a limited number of native genomic sequences and integrate introduced plasmid DNA into them. These native sequences termed pseudo att sites, resemble the wild type phage attachment site enough to support integrase-mediated integration. Molecular evolution holds the promise of creating custom integrases that preferentially recombine at particular pseudo att sites. Furthermore the system has no apparent size limit on carrying capacity. These features make the phi C31 integrase system extremely appealing for gene therapy applications. The system has been successfully employed in several model gene therapy studies to date. Here we review the development of this novel integration system and its current and potential applications to gene therapy.",

The phenotype of \"classically activated macrophages\" (M1) has anti-tumoricidal and anti-bactericidal activities. On the other hand, \"alternatively activated macrophages\" (M2) are involved in tissue remodeling and immunomodulatory functions. The change in the polarization of macrophages varies according to the diversity of cytokines present in the microenvironment or by the stimuli of an antigen. It involves such factors as interferon-regulatory factors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). Switching the phenotype of macrophages can help attenuate the development of an inflammatory disease. Exercise can promote alterations in the number of innate immune cells and stimulates phagocytic function. Chronic exercise seems to inhibit macrophage infiltration into adipose tissue by attenuating the expression of F4/80 mRNA. Furthermore, exercise may also increase the expression of M2 markers and reduce TNF-[alpha] and TLR4 mRNA expression, which activates the inflammatory pathway of NF-[kappa]B. Chronic exercise reduces [beta]2-adrenergic receptors in monocytes and macrophages by modulating TLR4 signaling as well as suppressing IL-12 production, a stimulator of interferon Y.

Recent research efforts in TLR biology suggest that targeting the TLRs and their signaling pathways during HCV infection could contribute to novel therapies against HCV. The mobilization of TLRs boosts antiviral communication and integrates the development of long-lasting acquired immune responses to limit viral pathogenesis.

In order to sustain increased growth rate requires an efficient assimilation of nutrients from the intestinal lumen, which is permitted through nutrient assimilation through the enterocytes that is facilitated by many nutrient transporter proteins. These trans-membrane proteins have specific action, well known kinetics and assist in the partitioning of nutrients among tissues. Amino acids are transported across the plasma membrane as free amino acids or short chain peptides through several independent systems encoded by various nutrient transporter gene products, and these systems may act on multiple substrates. Any deficiency in amino acid and peptide transportation results in metabolic disorders, illustrating crucial roles being played by the body's ability to maintain amino acid homeostasis. The ability of tissues to adapt to changes in input of amino acids related to numerous external factors that negatively affect amino acids utilization appears to result from responses that alter nutrient transporter protein mRNA expression mandated for to maintain amino acid and protein homeostasis. This review summarizes the results of some recently published scientific articles on the effects of different factors that influence intestinal amino acid and peptide transporter proteins mRNA expressions in domestic fowl. Understanding the regulatory effects of diet on amino acid and peptide transport systems in tissues offers insight that ostensibly will help nutritionists to improve the efficiency of dietary protein utilization in poultry.",

Along with elucidating the beneficial facts of Z. officinale, this article may also aid in understanding the molecular basis of its effects in T2DM. The mechanistic rationale for antidiabetic effects of Z. officinale includes the inhibition of several transcriptional pathways, lipid peroxidation, carbohydrate-metabolizing enzymes, and HMG-CoA reductase and the activation of antioxidant enzyme capacity and low-density lipoprotein receptors. Consequently, by targeting these pathways, Z. officinale shows its antidiabetic therapeutic effects by increasing insulin sensitivity/synthesis, protecting beta -cells of pancreatic islets, reducing fat accumulation, decreasing oxidative stress, and increasing glucose uptake by the tissues. In addition to these effects, Z. officinale also exhibits protective effects against several diabetes-linked complications, notably nephropathy and diabetic cataract, by acting as an antioxidant and antiglycating agent.

Over 100 novel substrates of PARP-1 have been identified, most of which are involved in cellular processes such as ribosome biogenesis and transcription regulation. In addition, PARP-1 functions in inflammation by modulating inflammatory-relevant gene expression. PARP-1 also is involved in the tissue damage caused by ischemia/reperfusion conditions.

Belatacept, a costimulatory inhibitor, is currently being studied in different regimens in an effort to replace the use of calcineurin inhibitors to induce tolerance and to improve long-term outcomes. Induction therapy is now being used in more than 90% of kidney transplants and more than 50% cases of other solid-organ transplantation such as lung, heart, and intestinal transplants. As a result of these combination immunosuppressive (IS) therapy protocols, not only the incidence but also the intensity of episodes of acute rejection have decreased markedly, and at present 1-year graft and patient survival is almost 98% for kidney transplant recipients and approximately greater than 80% for heart and lung transplants. Evolving concepts include the use of donor-derived bone marrow mesenchymal cells to induce tolerance, to minimize the use of maintenance IS agents, and to prevent the development of adverse events associated with long-term use of maintenance IS therapy.",

In the last several decades, the incidence of GC has decreased, which should be credited to advances in diagnostic and therapeutic technologies including tumor-marker detection systems, imaging modalities, pathological methods, gastroscopy, and particularly surgical and pharmacologic interventions. Because they are economical, convenient, and noninvasive, the detection of conventional serum tumor biomarkers (e.g., CEA, CA19-9, and CA72-4) has been widely employed in the diagnosis and evaluation of GC.

Cytoskeleton dynamics have been established in the neural physiology, but only at the level of axonal development and growth. Retina has not been adequately studied in the context of cytoskeletal proteins. Methods: We reviewed the last 10 years of literature with reference to the development, growth, degeneration, and regeneration of the retina and the role of cytoskeleton in each aspect. We have focused on various changes that the retina undergoes at the cytosolic and cytoskeletal levels in the course of degeneration as well as regeneration. Findings: For this review, we compiled research articles pertaining to the role of cytoskeletal and other associated proteins involved in development of retina, which used various animal models. The effect of SNPs in the cytoskeletal proteins and their impact in retinal degeneration is also discussed.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most lethal malignancies worldwide because of its aggressive property and limited therapeutic options. Studies suggest that aberrant alternative splicing promotes generation of oncogenic variants in HCC, whereas tumor suppressors are self-inactivated by aberrant alternative splicing in HCC. Moreover, different spliced variants of the same gene can display distinct and even antagonistic biological functions in HCC. As a result, inhibiting the splicing of oncogenic variants and the self-inactivation of tumor suppressors are likely to be new therapy strategies.

Pyridine nucleotides participate in numerous metabolic reactions whereby their net cellular level remains constant, but the ratios of NAD super(+)/NADP super(+) and NADH/NADPH oscillate according to metabolic changes in response to diverse stress signals. In non-redox reactions, NAD super(+) is degraded and quickly, afterward, resynthesized in the NAD super(+) salvage pathway, unless overwhelming activation of PARP-1 consumes NAD super(+) to the point of no return, when the cell can no longer generate enough ATP to accommodate NAD super(+) resynthesis. The activity of PARP-1 is mandatory for the onset of cytoprotective autophagy on sublethal stress signals. It has become increasingly clear that redox status, largely influenced by the metabolism-dependent composition of the pyridine nucleotides pool, plays an important role in the synthesis of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic sphingolipids.

In addition to the more than 1200 human miRNAs, human DNA tumor viruses such as Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and EpsteinBarr virus (EBV) encode miRNAs. Target predictions indicate that each miRNA targets hundreds of transcripts, many of which are regulated by multiple miRNAs. Thus, target identification is a big challenge for the field. Most methods used currently investigate single miRNA-target interactions and are not able to analyze complex miRNA-target networks. To overcome these challenges, cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP), a recently developed method to study direct RNA-protein interactions in living cells, has been successfully applied to miRNA target analysis. It utilizes Argonaute (Ago)-immunoprecipitation to isolate native Ago-miRNA-mRNA complexes. In four recent publications, two variants of the CLIP method (HITS-CLIP and PAR-CLIP) were utilized to determine the targetomes of human and viral miRNAs in cells infected with the gamma-herpesviruses KSHV and EBV, which are associated with a number of human cancers. Here, we briefly introduce herpesvirus-encoded miRNAs and then focus on how CLIP technology has largely impacted our understanding of viral miRNAs in viral biology and pathogenesis.",

However, it is not known whether such dysfunction is secondary to the broad neuronal damage accompanying prion diseases or whether it underlies pathological interactions of prions with calcium channels. In this research, we examined this latter possibility by searching for channel binding signatures in PrP super(c) through structural comparison with known N-type channel blockers. To this aim, a computational method devised by us to recognize similar distributions of basic residues in protein structures enabled us to find that the bioactive groups representing the pharmacophores of omega -conotoxins GVIA and MVIIA can be overlaid onto similar residues within the PrP super(c) globular domain. This finding, together with the knowledge that Ca super(2+) homeostasis disruption is common to other neurodegenerative disorders, led us to search for and identify an omega -conotoxin-like pharmacophore also in the Alzheimer's A beta (1-42) peptide.

Yet in recent years, more and more evidence has shown that the ANP/NPRA signaling pathway plays an important role in human cancer. For example, NPRA is abundantly expressed on tumorigenic mouse and human prostate cancer (PCa) cells, but not in nontumorigenic prostate epithelial cells and down-regulation of NPRA-induced apoptosis in PCa cells. Dexamethasone can increase the expression of ANP markedly, and that is the reason why dexamethasone is the cornerstone in the treatment of multiple myeloma. NPRA deficiency can substantially protect C57BL/6 mice from lung, skin, and ovarian cancers. These results strongly suggest ANP and NPRA may play an anti-cancer and carcinogenesis role, respectively, and this signaling pathway could be a more potent target for cancer therapy. In light of these new insights, this review will summarize the structures, functions, and their regulation by cell signaling, and their different impacts on tumors.",

RUNX1 binds to specific DNA binding sites in regulatory elements of genes and recruits epigenetic cofactors to target loci. In this way histone modification patterns and the chromatin environment are altered, which results in adjusted gene expression. The process of transcription factor binding and cofactor recruitment is dynamic and strongly influenced by specific posttranslational modifications, which are triggered by signaling. In this way cellular signaling is integrated at the epigenetic level by transcription factors. The identification of epigenetic cofactors and the study of their epigenetic influence on transcription is crucial for the understanding of transcription factor function in differentiation and disease. In this article, the recent observation that RUNX1 is associated with the protein arginine methyltransferase 6 will be reviewed. PRMT6 triggers H3R2me2a at RUNX1 target genes; this histone modification negatively influences the positive H3K4me3 mark and this way acts repressive. The RUNX1/PRMT6 association has an impact on bivalent histone marks. Upon differentiation, a RUNX1 corepressor complex with PRMT6 is exchanged with a RUNX1 coactivator complex.

Here, we review the suppressor or oncogene roles of Nrf2 in different stages of specific tumors with respect to the newest studies. Further, we suspect that the hypoxic microenvironment around the tumors is the main crux which determines the role of Nrf2 in the tumor initiation, invasion, and metastasis. In the initiation of tumors, Nrf2 or Keap 1 genes get mutations under the oxidative stress; as a result, the tumor cells obtain the advantage to growth. At the later stages, the hypoxic microenvironment around the malignant tumors has a profound influence on the character of Nrf2. Under the hypoxic microenvironment, expression of certain downstream genes of Nrf2 involved in angiogenesis are obviously elevated; other transcription factors derived from hypoxic microenvironment interact with Nrf2 and in that way promote or inhibit the invasion and metastasis.",

Over the last century our understanding of the biology of radiation exposure as well as our ability to safely deliver extraordinarily high doses of radiation to specific targets has led to its routine use in both curative and palliative settings for most solid tumors. External radiation beam techniques invariably involve irradiating normal tissues that are located between the radiation source and the intended target. High-energy linear accelerators have greatly reduced skin and subcutaneous radiation-induced injury; however, radiation tolerances of organs adjacent to the target do frequently limit the total amount of radiation that can be used. Intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) can be delivered in a number of ways, with the ultimate intent of minimizing normal tissue exposure to potentially harmful doses of radiation. Multiple IORT delivery modalities are now available, all of which present potential advantages and disadvantages over other methods of treatment.

Recently, the utility of LCLs was extended to pharmacogenomic studies to discover genetic factors underlying individual variations in response to chemicals and environmental stresses. Although LCLs represent generally lymphoid tissue-specific biological characteristics, genomic signatures of LCLs can distinguish patients with brain-related diseases and nonlymphoid tumors from normal controls.

For integrative genomic analyses, LCLs can be utilized to generate cellular phenotypes and various genomic data (e.g., SNP, CNV, transcriptome, methylome, etc.), which can be linked to clinical information of donors.

What role therefore can endocytosis and endolysosomes (E/L) play in the signal transduction process? As will be detailed below, in many cases involving growth factors, inhibition of E/L proteases results in complete or very significant loss of growth factor activity. That is, treatment with inhibitors of E/L proteases (i.e., leupeptin, antipain methylamine, etc.) erases the normal activity of growth factors affecting systems of concern to immunologists, endocrinologists, and cardiologists.

Significantly, the expression of BIM by tumor cells has been shown to play an important role in determining the response of transformed cells to not only conventional cytotoxic agents, but also to a broad array of targeted agents that interrupt cell signaling and survival pathways.

        "des": "More than 300 million years ago, vertebrates emerged from the vast oceans to conquer gravity and the dry land. With this transition, new adaptations occurred that included ingenious changes in reproduction, waste secretion, and bone physiology. One new innovation, the egg shell, contained an ancestral protein (ovocleidin-116) that likely first appeared with the dinosaurs and was preserved through the theropod lineage in modern birds and reptiles. Ovocleidin-116 is an avian homolog of matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein (MEPE) and belongs to a group of proteins called short integrin-binding ligand-interacting glycoproteins (SIBLINGs). These proteins are all localized to a defined region on chromosome 5q in mice and chromosome 4q in humans. A unifying feature of SIBLING proteins is an acidic serine aspartate-rich MEPE-associated motif (ASARM). Recent research has shown that the ASARM motif and the released ASARM peptide have regulatory roles in mineralization (bone and teeth), phosphate regulation, vascularization, soft-tissue calcification, osteoclastogenesis, mechanotransduction, and fat energy metabolism. The MEPE ASARM motif and peptide are physiological substrates for PHEX, a zinc metalloendopeptidase. Defects in PHEX are responsible for X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (HYP). There is evidence that PHEX interacts with another ASARM motif containing SIBLING protein, dentin matrix protein-1 (DMP1). DMP1 mutations cause bone and renal defects that are identical with the defects caused by a loss of PHEX function. This results in autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets (ARHR). In both HYP and ARHR, increased FGF23 expression plays a major role in the disease and in autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets (ADHR), FGF23 half-life is increased by activating mutations. ASARM peptide administration in vitro and in vivo also induces increased FGF23 expression. FGF23 is a member of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family of cytokines, which surfaced 500 million years ago with the boney fish (i.e., teleosts) that do not contain SIBLING proteins. In terrestrial vertebrates, FGF23, like SIBLING proteins, is expressed in the osteocyte. The boney fish, however, are an-osteocytic, so a physiological bone-renal link with FGF23 and the SIBLINGs was cemented when life ventured from the oceans to the land during the Triassic period, approximately 300 million years ago. This link has been revealed by recent research that indicates a competitive displacement of a PHEX-DMP1 interaction by an ASARM peptide that leads to increased FGF23 expression. This review discusses the new discoveries that reveal a novel PHEX, DMP1, MEPE, ASARM peptide, and FGF23 bone-renal pathway. This pathway impacts not only bone formation, bone-renal mineralization, and renal phosphate homeostasis but also energy metabolism. The study of this new pathway is relevant for developing therapies for several diseases: bone-teeth mineral loss disorders, renal osteodystrophy, chronic kidney disease and bone mineralization disorders (CKD-MBD), end-stage renal diseases, ectopic arterial-calcification, cardiovascular disease renal calcification, diabetes, and obesity.",

This observation indicates that PCa cells were present outside of the prostate at the time of prostatectomy and remained dormant.

DTCs parasitize the bone microenvironment, where they derive support and impact the microenvironment itself. These DTCs appear to be a heterogeneous population of PCa cells; however, some of them appear to have some aspects of a cancer stem cell (CSC) phenotype as they can develop into clinically detectable metastases. The concept of CSC is controversial; however, several markers of CSC have been identified for PCa, which may represent cells of either basal or luminal origin. These DTCs have now been shown to compete for the hematopoietic stem cell niche in bone, where they may be placed in a dormant state. Interaction with a variety of host factors, including cytokine and cells, may impact the metastatic development and progression, including the dormant state.

In this review, we summarize the epigenetic effects of maspin and provide comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of microarray-derived gene expression changes caused by maspin in different microenvironments. The analysis was performed on multiple levels, including identification of statistically enriched gene ontology groups, detection of overreprepresented transcription factors binding sites in promoters of differentially expressed genes, followed by searching for key nodes of regulatory networks controlling these transcription factors. The results are consistent with our hypothesis that maspin serves as an endogenous regulator of HDAC activity and suggest that the effect of maspin is primarily mediated by TGF beta , beta -catenin/E-cadherin pathways, and network key nodes such as Abl kinase, p62, IL1, and caspases 6 and 8.",

Parathyroid hormone (PTH), the only FDAapproved treatment that adds bone to the aged skeleton, loses its potency within two years of initial treatment but the mechanism regulating its limited \"anabolic window\" is unknown. We have discovered that disabling the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling transcription factor nuclear matrix protein 4/cas interacting zinc finger protein (Nmp4/CIZ) in mice extends the PTH bone-forming capacity. Nmp4 was discovered during our search for nuclear matrix transcription factors that couple this hormone's impact on osteoblast cytoskeletal and nuclear organization with its anabolic capacity. CIZ was independently discovered as a protein that associates with the focal adhesion-associated mechanosensor p130Cas. The Nmp4/CIZ-knockout (KO) skeletal phenotype exhibits a modestly enhanced bone mineral density but manifests an exaggerated response to both PTH and to BMP2 and is resistant to disuse-induced bone loss. The cellular basis of the global Nmp4/CIZ-KO skeletal phenotype remains to be elucidated but may involve an expansion of the bone marrow osteoprogenitor population along with modestly enhanced osteoblast and osteoclast activities supporting anabolic bone turnover. As a shuttling Cys sub(2)His sub(2) zinc finger protein, Nmp4/CIZ acts as a repressive transcription factor perhaps associated with epigenetic remodeling complexes, but the functional significance of its interaction with p130Cas is not known.

However, major hurdles in the clinical development of GF therapies include the high cost, the unwanted side effects, and the toxicity associated with the physiological overdosing required to achieve a successful outcome. These drawbacks may be overcome with the application of particular HS fractions that have been optimized to bind, recruit and enhance the biological activity of endogenous GF at the site of injury. Three HS-based treatments are discussed here: first, the single, localized, and sustained delivery of HS as a stand-alone therapeutic agent; then, the inclusion of an HS component within a delivery device so as to stabilize and potentiate the bioactivity of the incorporated GF; and finally, the growing use of HS mimetics, particularly for bone repair.",

Interest in these compounds stems from their utility as fluorescent markers, they have therapeutic uses, are biomarkers, biomolecular probes, supramolecular building blocks, and for conformational studies. Until recently, the selective arylation of the C8-position of purines has been a challenging task. Several approaches have been explored including building them up from a pyrimidine or selective C8-modification of an unsubstituted purine. Neither of these approaches has proven to have broad scope. The discovery that C8-aryl purine nucleosides can be made via the Suzuki cross-coupling reaction has allowed a diverse array of analogues to be prepared and, in turn, the corresponding phosphoramidites. The latter is particularly significant as C8-aryl purine adducts are a major mutation observed from aromatic carcinogens and ready access to C8-aryl phosporamidites will facilitate the synthesis and study of C8-aryl purine biomarkers and modified oligonucleotides.",

It is a multifactorial disorder to which several factors-such as age, sex, trauma, and obesity-contribute significantly. Obesity is one of the most influential but modifiable risk factors because it exerts an increased mechanical stress on the tibiofemoral cartilage. However, the high prevalence of OA in obese individuals in non-weightbearing areas, like finger joints, suggests that the link between being overweight and OA lies with factors other than simple biomechanics. An important correlation has been made between obesity and inflammation. Adipose tissues (and the infrapatellar fat pad) play an important role in this context because they are the major source of cytokines, chemokines, and metabolically active mediators called adipokines (or adipocytokines). These metabolic factors are known to possess catabolic and proinflammatory properties and to orchestrate the pathophysiological processes in OA. This review provides information on the relationship between obesity and OA through biomechanical and biochemical factors and highlights the functions of important obesity-related inflammatory products in the initiation and progression of OA.

The literature is reviewed from the point of view of these concepts. The balance between anabolic and catabolic processes induces chemical potentials in the extracellular and intracellular media. The chemical potentials of these media are defined as the driving forces of both passive and active transport of substances across cellular membranes. The driving forces of substance transport across cellular membranes as in cellular metabolism and in immune responses and hormonal expressions are considered in the biochemical and biophysical models, reflecting the mechanisms for maintenance of stability of the internal medium and internal energy of an organism. The interactions of passive transport and active transport of substances across cellular walls promote cell proliferation, as well as the mechanism of cellular capacitors, promoting remote reactions across distance for hormonal expression and immune responses. The offered concept of cellular capacitors has given the possibility to explain the mechanism of remote responses of cells to new situations, resulting in the appearance of additional agents. The biophysical model develops an explanation of some cellular functions: cellular membrane action have been identified with capacitor action, based on the similarity of the structures and as well as on similarity of biophysical properties of electric data that confirm the action of the compound-specific interactions of cells within an organism, promoting hormonal expressions and immune responses to stabilize the thermodynamic system of an organism. Comparison of a cellular membrane action to a capacitor has given the possibility for the explanations of exocytosis and endocytosis mechanisms, internalization of the receptor-ligand complex, selection as a receptor reaction to a ligand by immune responses or hormonal effects, reflecting cellular distance reactions on the hormonal expressions, immune responses, and specificity of the mechanisms of immune reactions. Reviewing current research of cell activity, explanations are presented of mechanisms of apoptosis, autophagy, hormonal expression, and immune responses from the point of view of described cellular mechanisms.

Explanations of the mechanism of the presented method are provided from the points of view of biochemistry, physical chemistry, and biophysics, and also using the concept of the Warburg effect (most cancer cells predominantly produce energy by a high rate of glycolysis in the cytosol, rather than by a comparatively low rate of glycolysis followed by oxidation of pyruvate in mitochondria like most normal cells).

While type 1 diabetes is associated with reduced bone mineral density, this is not usually seen in type 2 diabetes. Hyperglycemia, present in both type 1 and 2 diabetes, alters bone matrix proteins such as collagen I through nonenzymatic glycation, which can decrease bone toughness and increase fracture risk even in the absence of bone loss. Diabetes is also associated with increased inflammation and altered adipokine and calcitrophic hormone levels, which further contribute to bone pathophysiology. As medical advances significantly lengthen patient lifespan, exposure to diabetic conditions increases and correspondingly so do disease complications.

Development of the notochord is tightly regulated by interactive transcription factors and target genes. Since a number of these molecules are unique they have be used for cell lineage and fate mapping studies of tissues of the intervertebral disc. These studies have shown that in a number of species including human, NP tissue retains notochordal cells throughout life. In the adult NP, there are present both large and small notochordal cells, as well as a progenitor cell population which can differentiate along the mesengeic pathway. Since tissue renewal in the intervertebral disc is dependent on the ability of these cells to commit to the NP lineage and undergo terminal differentiation, studies have been performed to assess which signaling pathways may regulate these activities. The notch signaling pathway is active in the intervertebral disc and is responsive to hypoxia, probably through HIF-1a. From a disease viewpoint, it is hypothesized that an oxemic shift, possibly mediated by alterations in the vascular supply to the tissues of the disc would be expected to lead to a failure in notochordal progenitor cell activation and a decrease in the number of differentiated cells.

As such, autophagy is tumor suppressive. In contrast, it is important to note that although tumor cells have reduced levels of autophagy, they do not eliminate this pathway completely. Furthermore, the exposure of tumor cells to an environment of increased metabolic and other stresses renders them reliant on basal autophagy for survival. Therefore, autophagy inhibition is an active avenue for the identification of novel anti-cancer therapies.

HNSCC patients with metastatic disease have extremely poor prognoses, with an average survival rate of less than a year. Metastasis is an intricate sequential process that requires a discrete population of tumor cells to possess the capacity to intravasate from the primary tumor into systemic circulation, survive in circulation, extravasate at a distant site, and proliferate in a foreign, hostile environment. Literature has accumulated to provide mechanistic insight into several signal transduction pathways, receptor tyro-sine kinases (RTKs), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3), Rho GTPases, protein kinase C[epsilon] (PKCs[epsilon]), and nuclear factor- Kappa B (NF- Kappa B), that are involved in mediating a metastatic tumor cell phenotype in HN-SCC.

The end result is the release of free amino acids and metabolites for use in cell survival. For tumor cells, autophagy is a double-edged sword: autophagy genes are frequently mono-allelically deleted, silenced, or mutated in human tumors, resulting in an environment of increased oxidative stress that is conducive to DNA damage, genomic instability, and tumor progression. As such, autophagy is tumor suppressive. In contrast, it is important to note that although tumor cells have reduced levels of autophagy, they do not eliminate this pathway completely. Furthermore, the exposure of tumor cells to an environment of increased metabolic and other stresses renders them reliant on basal autophagy for survival. Therefore, autophagy inhibition is an active avenue for the identification of novel anti-cancer therapies. Not surprisingly, the field of autophagy and cancer has experienced an explosion of research in the past 10 years. This review covers the basic mechanisms of autophagy, discusses its role in tumor suppression and cancer therapy, and posits emerging questions for the future.",

Mdm2 is also believed to control its own levels by autoubiquitination. Despite the widespread acceptance of these hypotheses, the supporting data were drawn primarily from in vitro and ectopic expression studies, which have not always been corroborated when tested in the more physiologically relevant setting of a knock-in or knock-out mouse model. Recently, a mouse model was generated in which a single point mutation (C462A) in Mdm2's RING domain abrogated Mdm2's E3 activity while leaving Mdm2-p53 binding intact. This study called into question two major dogmas about Mdm2 by suggesting that when endogenously expressed, (1) Mdm2 cannot inhibit p53 sufficiently by binding without ubiquitination, and (2) Mdm2 may not be regulated by autoubiquitination. Two years later, we are still without definitive answers for why these results conflict with previous findings, but we have gained new insights from subsequent studies.

There are many causes of heterotopic ossification (HO), including soft tissue trauma, central nervous system injury, vasculopathies, arthropathies, and inheritance. One of the least understood components of HO is the interaction of the peripheral nervous system with the induction of this process. Recent work has shown that, upon traumatic injury, a cascade of events termed neurogenic inflammation is initiated, which involves the release of neuropeptides, such as substance P and calcitonin gene related peptide. Release of these peptides ultimately leads to the recruitment of activated platelets, mast cells, and neutrophils to the injury site. These cells appear to be involved with both remodeling of the nerve, as well as potentially recruiting additional cells from the bone marrow to the injury site. Further, sensory neurons stimulated at the injury site relay local information to the brain, which can then redirect neuroendocrine signaling in the hypothalamus towards repair of the injured site. While numerous studies have highlighted the important role of nerve-derived signals, both central and peripheral, in the regulation of normal bone remodeling of the skeleton,1 this review focuses on the role of the local, peripheral nerves in the formation of heterotopic bone. We concentrate on the manner in which local changes in bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) expression contribute to a cascade of events within the peripheral nerves, both sensory and sympathetic, in the immediate area of HO formation.",

Analyses of radiographic imaging and clinical examination, in combination, remain the gold standard for diagnosis; however, these methods are not reliable for early detection. Delayed diagnosis of a nonunion is costly from both the patient and treatment standpoints. In response, repeated efforts have been made to identify bone metabolic markers as diagnostic or prognostic tools for monitoring bone healing. Thus far, the evidence regarding a correlation between the kinetics of most bone metabolic markers and nonunion is very limited. With the aim of classifying the role of biological pathways of bone metabolism and of understanding bone conditions in the development of osteoporosis, advances have been made in our knowledge of the molecular basis of bone remodeling, fracture healing, and its failure. Procollagen type I amino-terminal propeptide has been shown to be a reliable bone formation marker in osteoporosis therapy and its kinetics during fracture healing has been recently described.

It stimulates placental calcium (and possibly magnesium) transfer and raises blood mineral levels above ambient maternal values in order to effect mineralization of the skeleton. It does not upregulate in response to absence of PTH or hypocalcemia, and thus, its secretion may be regulated autonomously or in response to placental signals. PTH is expressed in fetal parathyroids and placenta. Despite circulating at low levels, it has a more dominant effect than PTHrP in regulating the blood calcium and ensuring adequate mineralization of the skeleton. It may also have effects on bone formation in the steps that occur after apoptosis of hypertrophic chondrocytes. Unlike PTHrP, it increases with fetal hypocalcemia, but its secretion is constrained by the calcium-sensing receptor to maintain the adult calcium level, well below what the fetus normally achieves.

Exciting new strategies for endogenous and exogenous regeneration have been proposed. However, questions remain as to whether these approaches can provide enough new myocyte mass to sufficiently restore mechanical function to the heart. In this article, we consider the mechanisms of endogenous cardiomyocyte regeneration and exogenous cell differentiation (with respect to myoblasts, stem cells, and induced pluripotent cells being researched for cell therapies). We begin by reviewing some of the cues that are being harnessed in strategies of gene/cell therapy for regenerating myocardium. We also consider some of the technical challenges that remain in determining new myocyte generation, tracking delivered cells in vivo, and correlating new myocyte contractility with cardiac function. Strategies for regenerating the heart are being realized as both animal and clinical trials suggest that these new approaches provide short-term improvement of cardiac function. However, a more complete understanding of the underlying mechanisms and applications is necessary to sustain longer-term therapeutic success.",

Given the high morbidity and mortality rates associated with congestive heart failure, the shortage of donor hearts for transplantation, complications resulting from immunosuppression, and long-term failure of transplanted organs, regeneration of the diseased myocardium by cell transplantation is an attractive therapeutic modality. Because of their remarkable capacity for expansion and unquestioned cardiac potential, pluripotent human embryonic stem cells (hESC) represent an attractive candidate cell source for obtaining cardiomyocytes. Moreover, a number of recent reports have shown that hESC-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CM) survive after transplantation into infarcted rodent hearts, form stable cardiac implants, and result in preserved contractile function. Although the latter successes give good reason for optimism, considerable challenges remain in the successful application of hESC-CM to cardiac repair. Because it is desired that the transplanted cells fully integrate within the diseased myocardium, contribute to its contractile performance, and respond appropriately to various physiological stimuli, it is of crucial importance to be familiar with their functional properties. Therefore, this review describes the characteristics of hESC-CM, including their transcriptional profile, structural and electrophysiological properties, ion channel expression, excitation-contraction coupling, and neurohumoral responsiveness.",

There are many causes of heterotopic ossification (HO), including soft tissue trauma, central nervous system injury, vasculopathies, arthropathies, and inheritance. One of the least understood components of HO is the interaction of the peripheral nervous system with the induction of this process. Recent work has shown that, upon traumatic injury, a cascade of events termed neurogenic inflammation is initiated, which involves the release of neuropeptides, such as substance P and calcitonin gene related peptide. Release of these peptides ultimately leads to the recruitment of activated platelets, mast cells, and neutrophils to the injury site. These cells appear to be involved with both remodeling of the nerve, as well as potentially recruiting additional cells from the bone marrow to the injury site. Further, sensory neurons stimulated at the injury site relay local information to the brain, which can then redirect neuroendocrine signaling in the hypothalamus towards repair of the injured site. While numerous studies have highlighted the important role of nerve-derived signals, both central and peripheral, in the regulation of normal bone remodeling of the skeleton,1 this review focuses on the role of the local, peripheral nerves in the formation of heterotopic bone. We concentrate on the manner in which local changes in bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) expression contribute to a cascade of events within the peripheral nerves, both sensory and sympathetic, in the immediate area of HO formation.",

Remarkable progress has been achieved during the last decade in our understanding the molecular mechanism of osteoclast differentiation, largely because of the discovery of receptor activator of NF-B ligand (RANKL), an essential cytokine for osteoclastogenesis. Osteoblasts express RANKL in response to bone-resorbing factors. Osteoblasts also produce osteoprotegerin (OPG), a decoy receptor for RANKL, which inhibits osteoclast differentiation and function by interrupting the interaction between RANKL and RANK, a receptor of RANKL. The identification of nuclear factor of activated T-cells cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1) as a master transcription factor for RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis has provided major insight into the molecular mechanism of osteoclast differentiation.

Radiosensitization can be attributed to the fact that heat is a pleiotropic damaging agent, affecting multiple cell components to varying degrees by altering protein structures, thus influencing the DNA damage response. Hyperthermia alone induces several steps associated with IR signaling in cells. For example, hyperthermia enhances ATM kinase activity and increases cellular ATM autophosphorylation. This prior activation of ATM or other components of the IR-induced signaling pathway by heat interferes with the normal IR-induced signaling required for chromosomal DNA double-strand break repair, thus resulting in increased cell killing post irradiation. Hyperthermia also induces heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) synthesis and enhances telomerase activity. HSP70 expression is associated with radioresistance. Inactivation of HSP70 and telomerase increases residual DNA DSBs post IR exposure, which correlates with increased cell killing, supporting the role of HSP70 and telomerase in IR-induced DNA damage repair. Thus, hyperthermia influences several molecular parameters involved in sensitizing tumor cells to radiation and can enhance the potential of targeted radiotherapy.",

Bone's adaptive response is regulated by the ability of resident bone cells to perceive and translate mechanical energy into a cascade of structural and biochemical changes within the cells -- a process known as mechanotransduction. Mechanotransduction pathways are among the most anabolic in bone, and consequently, there is great interest in elucidating how mechanical loading produces its observed effects, including increased bone formation, reduced bone loss, changes in bone cell differentiation and lifespan, among others. A molecular understanding of these processes is developing, and with it comes a profound new insight into the biology of bone. In this article, we review the nature of the physical stimulus to which bone cells mount an adaptive response, including the identity of the sensor cells, their attributes and physical environment, and putative mechanoreceptors they express. Particular attention is allotted to the focal adhesion and Wnt signaling, in light of their emerging role in bone mechanotransduction. The cellular mechanisms for increased bone loss during disuse, and reduced bone loss during loading are considered. Finally, we summarize the published data on bone cell accommodation, whereby bone cells stop responding to mechanical signaling events. Collectively, these data highlight the complex yet finely orchestrated process of mechanically regulated bone homeostasis.",

Higher-level organisms developed two sensory systems to detect environmental chemicals: olfaction and taste. Olfaction is used in many behaviors, such as kin recognition and mate selection, whereas taste is used primarily to determine whether potential food items will be ingested or rejected. The sense of taste involves the detection of five taste qualities: bitter, sweet, salty, sour, and umami, which is the detection of amino acids, specifically glutamate.

The development of the epidermis is a highly regulated process that begins by the commitment of a single layer of multipotent ectodermal cells to a keratinocyte cell fate. This is followed by stratification and a subsequent elaborate program of differentiation leading to the generation of a multilayered epidermis and patterned cutaneous appendages such as the hair follicles and sebaceous glands. The stratified epidermis occupying the space between skin appendages is referred to as the interfollicular epidermis (IFE) and is the focus of this review. Within the IFE, keratinocytes in the innermost basal layer are mitotically active. Upon specific cues, these cells undergo cell cycle arrest and execute a terminal differentiation program as they progress through spinous, granular, and cornified layers. This program operates continually throughout the life of an organism; dead cells sloughed off from the skin surface are replenished by basal cells moving outward in a highly synchronized fashion. Not surprisingly, at the heart of the control process is a dedicated group of transcription factors that ensure the integrity of the keratinocyte differentiation program by regulating gene expression in a temporally and spatially coordinated manner.

The understanding of how these vesicles are released from the plasma membrane and initiate the mineralization process may provide novel therapeutic strategies to prevent pathologic mineralization. In addition, other regulators (activators and inhibitors) of physiologic mineralization have been identified and characterized, and there is evidence that the same factors also contribute to the regulation of pathologic mineralization.

These processes are highly integrated and require continuous and coordinated regulation by soluble molecular signals and transcription factors to assure harmonious bone development and morphogenesis. In the bone, transcription factors often have multiple functions and control the differentiation of more than one skeletal cellular component. In particular, Distal-less (Dlx) homeobox transcription factors play a central role in regulating the proliferation and differentiation of the three major cell types that constitute bone: chondrocytes, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts. The aim of this review is to summarize what is known about the role of Dlx genes in osteogenesis and to emphasize their role as coordinators at different levels of skeletal development. The elucidation of these unifying roles could improve our understanding not only of bone development but also of adult bone anabolism and catabolism resulting in bone homeostasis and might thus help to further our understanding of the genetic factors responsible for predisposition to multifactorial conditions such as osteoporosis.",

Here we review some aspects of the cell physiology involved in these Ca super(2+)-signaling processes, with particular emphasis on the molecular mechanisms involved. Ca super(2+)-influx across the plasma membrane can occur via a variety of Ca super(2+)-channels, including voltage-operated, store-operated, and receptor-operated channels. Ca super(2+) may also be released from intracellular stores via RyR-, or IP sub(3)R-gated channels in the SR membrane. Using high-speed confocal Ca super(2+)-imaging, we have also demonstrated that the resulting signals are far from homogeneous, with spontaneous activity in retinal arterioles being characterized by both localized Ca super(2+)-sparks and more global Ca super(2+)-waves and oscillations. These signals may be specifically and differentially targeted, for example, to Ca super(2+)-sensitive ion channels (stimulus-excitation coupling), or pathways regulating contraction (stimulus-contraction coupling).

Runx2 is expressed in osteoblasts, prehypertrophic chondrocytes, mesenchymal cells of the perichondrium, T lymphocytes, endothelial cells, and breast and prostate epithelial cells, with increased expression observed in breast and prostate carcinomas. Although Runx2 and other mammalian Runt domain proteins were originally described as transcriptional activators, they are also transcriptional repressors and thus maintain functional similarities with their Drosophila homolog, Runt.

Moreover, estradiol-17 beta (E sub(2)) or dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which increased CK in organs from intact female or male rats, respectively, stimulated much less CK in vitamin D-depleted rats. Treatment of intact female rats with noncalcemic vitamin D analogs significantly upregulated E sub(2)- and DHT-induced CKresponse. These analogs upregulated the CK response to selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) in organs from intact or ovariectomized (Ovx) female rats but abolished SERMs' inhibitory effect on E sub(2)-induced CK. These analogs significantly increased estradiol receptor alpha (ER alpha ) protein in skeletal organs as well as histomorphological and biochemical changes due to this treatment followed by E sub(2) or DHT. The analogs alone markedly altered the growth plate and the trabeculae and increased trabecular bone volume (%TBV) and trabecular width. The addition of E sub(2) or DHT to this treatment restored all parameters as well as increased %TBV and cell proliferation. Treatment of Ovx female rats with JK 1624 F sub(2)-2 (JKF) decreased growth-plate width and increased %TBV, whereas QW 1624 F sub(2)-2 (QW) restored growth-plate width and %TBV. Treatment of E sub(2) with JKF restored %TBV and growth-plate width, whereas E sub(2) with QW restored all parameters, including cortical width. There was also upregulation of the response of CK to E sub(2) in both combined treatments. Our human-derived osteoblast (hObs)-like cell cultures respond to estrogenic compounds, and pretreating them with JKF upregulated the CK response to E sub(2), raloxifenc (Ral), and some phytoestrogens. ER alpha and ER beta proteins, as well as mRNA, were modulated by CB 1093 (CB) and JKF. JKF increased specific nuclear E sub(2) binding in female hObs but inhibited specific membranal E sub(2) binding. hObs express 25 hydroxyvitamin D sub(3)-1 alpha hydroxylase (1-OHase)-mRNA and its biological activity, which are both modulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH) and estrogenic compounds.

The pathway becomes progressively functional as oocyte growth advances, and it appears to play a role in the G sub(2)/M transition when meiosis resumes, at least in the in vitro spontaneous model. Even if the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors are present from the beginning, they function and release Ca super(2+) when the follicular antrum appears. Phospholipase C beta 1 (PLC beta 1) is first exclusively localized to the nucleus and then migrates to the cytoplasm when the oocyte is fully grown. During oocyte maturation PLC beta 1 is active in the cytoplasm before it migrates and becomes active in the nucleus just prior to germinal vesicle breakdown. Because a similar circuit is observed for protein kinase C a (PKC alpha ), PKC beta 1, PKC beta 2, and active mitogen-activated protein kinase, it is tempting to envisage that a feedback loop occurs between these pathways as demonstrated in other cell types. The chronology of these molecular movements into the oocyte reveals the particular and important role of the nucleus phosphoinositide cycle during oocyte meiosis.

Here we focus on the transcriptional targets of p53 that regulate the cell cycle. p53 induction of G1/S cell-cycle arrest is largely attributed to the transcriptional upregulation of p21 super(WAF1), and more recently, to the transcriptional repression of c-MYC. The role of p53 in G2/M cell-cycle arrest in response to DNA damage is more complex, involving multiple targets that can generally be considered to impinge upon either the cell cycle (e.g., Cyclin-B, cdc2, cdc25C) or the mitotic machinery (i.e., Topoisomerase II, B99/Gtse-1, and MAP4). The ability of p53 to regulate these two types of gene targets may reflect p53-mediated early versus late events in the G2/M cell-cycle arrest response.

Clonal studies of myofiber-associated cells further suggest that satellite cell myogeneity and diversion into Mesenchymal Alternative Differentiation (MAD) occur in vitro by a stochastic mechanism. However, in vivo this potential may be executed only when myogenic signals are impaired and the muscle tissue is compromised.

Recent data indicate that Smad3 also functions as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting apoptosis. In addition, Smad3 is essential for TGF- beta -mediated immune suppression, and it plays an important role in regulating transcriptional responses that are favorable to metastasis.

Although pluripotency as an essential function in multicellular organisms is conserved through evolution, mechanisms primed for differentiation contribute substantially to the differences among stem cells derived from different tissues or species. Transcriptome mapping analysis has determined the chromosomal domains of gene coexpression patterns specific to the ES state and demonstrated that regulation of ES cell development is operative at both the local chromosomal domain level and global level. Combinatorial signals from multiple pathways regulate the expression of key intrinsic factors critical for ES cell fate determination.

The current theory rests on the assumption of Ca-accumulating vesicles derived from the endoplasmic/ sarcoplasmic reticulum, which are equipped with an ATP-dependent Ca pump and IP sub(3)- or ryanodine-sensitive Ca-release channels/receptors. The alternative hypothesis proceeds from the idea of Ca storage at the high-affinity binding sites of F-actin subunits. Several prominent features of Ca signaling, which are not adequately described by the current concept, are inherent properties of the F-actin system and its dynamic state of treadmilling. F-actin is the only known biological Ca-binding system that has been proven by in vitro experiments to work within the physiological range of Ca concentrations and the only system that meets all necessary conditions to function as receptor-operated Ca store and as a coupling device between the Ca store and the store-operated Ca influx pathway. The most important properties of Ca signaling, such as store-channel coupling, quantal Ca release, spiking and oscillations, biphasic and \"phasic\" uptake kinetics, and Ca-induced Ca release, turn out to be systematic features of the new concept but remain unexplained by the classical vesicle storage hypothesis. A number of novel findings, specifically recent reports about direct effects of actin-specific toxins on Ca stores, have strengthened the new concept. The concept of F-actin-based Ca signaling combined with the notion of microvillar regulation of ion and substrate fluxes opens new aspects and far-reaching consequences, not only for cellular Ca signaling but also for various other cell functions, and represents an opportunity to connect several fields of cell physiology on the basis of a common mechanism.",

Current primary applications of PDT are age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and several types of cancer and precancer. Tumor vasculature and parenchyma cells are both potential targets of PDT damage. The preference of vascular versus cellular targeting is highly dependent upon the relative distribution of photosensitizers in each compartment, which is governed by the photosensitizer pharmacokinetic properties and can be effectively manipulated by the photosensitizer drug administration and light illumination interval (drug-light interval) during PDT treatment, or by the modification of photosensitizer molecular structure. PDT using shorter PS-light intervals mainly targets tumor vasculature by confining photosensitizer localization within blood vessels, whereas if the sensitizer has a reasonably long pharmacokinetic lifetime, then PDT at longer PS-light intervals can induce more tumor cellular damage, because the photosensitizer has then distributed into the tumor cellular compartment. This passive targeting mechanism is regulated by the innate photosensitizer physicochemical properties. In addition to the passive targeting approach, active targeting of various tumor endothelial and cellular markers has been studied extensively. The tumor cellular markers that have been explored for active photodynamic targeting are mainly tumor surface markers, including growth factor receptors, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, transferrin receptors, folic acid receptors, glucose transporters, integrin receptors, and insulin receptors.

Actin has been demonstrated to play an important role in the regulation of G1-phase progression. Because of its properties as a structural protein, actin is essential in cytokinesis and in cell spreading and, thus, is involved in G1-phase progression. As an intermediate factor in signal transduction, actin is likely to be involved in cell-cycle regulation induced by external signal molecules. And, finally, actin has been demonstrated to play a direct role in transcription. These observations indicate a prominent role of actin in the regulation of G1-phase progression.",

Because MDS is a heterogeneous disorder, specific gene abnormalities implicated in the pathogenesis of MDS have been difficult to identify. Cytogenetic abnormalities are seen in half of the MDS patients and generally consist of partial or complete chromosome deletion or addition, whereas balanced translocations are rare. Although point mutations of critical genes had been demonstrated to contribute to the development of MDS, there was no strong correlation between these mutations and clinical features. Recently, we reported the high incidence of somatic mutations in the AML1/RUNX1 gene (which is a critical regulator of definitive hematopoiesis and the most frequent target for translocation of acute myeloid leukemia [AML]) in MDS, especially refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB), RAEB in transformation (RAEBt), and AML following MDS (defined here as MDS/AML). The MDS/AML patients with AML1 mutations had a significantly worse prognosis than those without AML1 mutations. Most AML1 mutants lose trans-activation potential, which leads to a loss of AML1 function. These data indicate that AML1 point mutation is one of the major causes of MDS/AML, and \"MDS/AML with AML1 mutation\" represents a distinct clinicopathologic-genetic entity.",

The balance between proliferating and differentiated osteogenic cells at the suture areas between calvarial bones is essential for the control of suture maintenance and membranous bone formation. The mechanisms of regulation of cell apoptosis in suture areas begin to be understood. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) are important regulators of mesenchymal, preosteoblast, and osteoblast apoptosis in suture areas. Perturbations in FGF or BMP signaling lead to alter the number of apoptotic osteogenic cells, resulting in premature or delayed suture closure. Recent data indicate that FGF signaling downregulates preosteoblast apoptosis, thereby preventing premature fusion of adjacent mineralizing extremities. In contrast, continuous FGF signaling or constitutive FGF receptor activation, as well as BMP signaling, upregulate osteoblast apoptosis. Additionally, multiple signaling mechanisms, including PI3K and PKC, appear to be involved in the control of calvarial osteoblast apoptosis by FGF and BMP.

AML1-ETO inhibits normal definitive hematopoiesis and blocks erythroid differentiation. Several mechanistic models for the role of AML1-ETO in leukemia development have emerged over the last decade. Most of these models have emphasized the capacity of the fusion protein to redirect repressive cofactors, such as histone deacetylases (HDACs) and DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), to RUNX target genes, thereby reversing the hematopoietic transcriptional program activated by wild-type RUNX1a phenomenon referred to collectively in this review as the \"classical\" corepressor model.

In the adult, it is widely distributed in normal and various cancer tissues. In spite of the rarity of HHM in prostate cancer, PTHrP is widely distributed in prostate cancer cells. PTHrP is a precursor molecule with generation of various fragments with distinct biological activities. More recent studies have shown that there is intranuclear localization of PTHrP and that intracrine effects of the peptide are involved in promoting processes that result in tumor progression (cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell attachment and angiogenesis) in prostate cancer. PTHrP expression is controlled by three distinct promoters, with P3 being used most often in cancer cells. The factors that control PTHrP production via interaction with the promoters are growth factors, androgens, vitamin D analogs, and adenoviral proteins. TGF- beta and its effector Smad3 activate the P3 promoter through an AGAC box and an Ets binding site involving Ets1 and to some extent Ets2 proteins. In addition, TGF- beta stimulates P3 promoter activity via Smad-independent pathways that involve the p38 MAP kinase. Although the addition of PTHrP or transfection with the PTHrP gene in prostate cells results in effects that promote tumor development, studies that employ inhibition of PTHrP activity in vitro and in vivo are needed to establish a definitive role of this peptide in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer.",

The Runx1 protein possesses nuclear localization signals and is found exclusively in the nucleus, whereas PEBP2beta is located in the cytoplasm in most cells and tissues examined thus far. We investigated the mechanism by which PEBP2beta localizes to the cytoplasm and found that it associates with filamin A, an actin-binding cytoskeletal protein. Filamin A retains PEBP2beta in the cytoplasm, thereby hindering its engagement as a Runx1 partner. When filamin A is absent, PEBP2beta moves into the nucleus and enhances Runx1-dependent transcription. These observations highlight the significance of the subcellular localization of PEBP2beta in regulating its activity as a component of the PEBP2/CBF transcription factor. In humans, PEBP2beta is frequently targeted in the leukemia-associated chromosomal abnormality, inversion 16 (inv 16).

A nearly identical copy of the gene, SMN2, fails to compensate for the loss of SMN1 because exon 7 is alternatively spliced, producing a truncated protein, which is unstable. SMN1 and SMN2 differ by a critical C-to-T substitution at position 6 of exon 7 in SMN2 (C6U transition in mRNA). This substitution alone is enough to cause an exon 7 exclusion in SMN2. Various cis- and trans-acting factors have been shown to neutralize the inhibitory effects of C6U transition. Published reports propose models in which either abrogation of an enhancer element associated with SF2/ASF or gain of a silencer element associated with hnRNP A1 is the major cause of exon 7 exclusion in SMN2. Most recent model suggests the presence of an EXtended INhibitory Context (Exinct) that is formed as a consequence of C6U transition in exon 7 of SMN2. In Exinct model, several factors may affect exon 7 splicing through cooperative interactions. Such regulation may be common to many alternatively spliced exons in humans.

Rather, myeloid gene transcription is regulated by the combinatorial effects of a limited number of key transcription factors. Sp1 is a powerful activator of gene transcription in many cell types. Although it is wildly expressed, Sp1 binds and activates the promoters of a large number of important myeloid genes. This presents the paradox of how a widely expressed transcription factor can regulate lineage-specific gene transcription. This review discusses the structure, function, and expression patterns of Sp1 and its related Sp family members. Illustrative examples of the tissue-specific regulation of myeloid target genes are presented. The roles of post-translational modifications of Sp1, alterations in target gene chromatin structure, and important cooperating transcription factors are discussed. Thus, Sp1 serves as a model of how a widely expressed transcription factor regulates the expression of tissue-specific genes.",

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family member, RANK ligand (RANKL) expressed on marrow stromal/osteoblast cells in response to several osteotropic factors, is critical for osteoclast precursor differentiation to form multinucleated osteoclasts, which resorb bone. M-CSF is required for proliferation, survival, and expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B (RANK) in osteoclast precursors. The interaction of RANKL-RANK results in activation of various signaling cascades during osteoclast development and activation. The osteoclast is an autocrine/paracrine, intracrine regulatory cell that produces factors such as IL-6, Annexin II, TGF- beta , OIP-1/hSca, which influence its own formation and activity. In addition, integrin expression in osteoclasts mediate cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions in the bone microenvironment through specific signaling pathways resulting in cytoskeletal organization, polarization, and activation of osteoclasts to resorb bone. Recent molecular genetic studies have identified several transcription factors, such as NF- Kappa B, c-Fos, MITF, and NFATc1, which are essential for osteoclast differentiation. Although a wide variety of molecules, including the reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are differentially regulated during osteoclastogenesis, the precise signal transduction pathways, and molecular mechanisms underlying the gene expression in osteoclasts, are just beginning to be defined.

Recent studies have focused on histone arginine and lysine methylation and the roles of these modifications in transcriptional regulation and the establishment of heterochromatin. Concomitantly, several families of histone methyltransferases (HMTs) have been identified that catalyze the methylation of specific arginines or lysines in histones H3 and H4. Not surprisingly, many of these methyltransferase genes had been previously identified as important genetic regulators in organisms such as yeast and Drosophila, which underscores the importance of histone methylation in transcriptional control and chromatin remodeling. Structures of several representatives of these HMT families have recently been determined, yielding insight into their catalytic mechanism and histone substrate specificity.

NE cells are derived from non-NE prostate cancer cells and secrete factors that can act in a paracrine manner to stimulate the survival, growth, motility, and metastatic potential of prostatic carcinoma cells. Factors such as IL-6, epinephrine, and forskolin induce NE differentiation in prostate cancer cells; the mechanisms involve increases in intracellular cAMP, protein kinase A (PKA) activation and reduced intracellular calcium levels. Transcription factors implicated in the acquisition of NE characteristics by prostate cancer cells include STAT3, CREB, EGR1, c-fos, and NF-kappaB. Expression of Chromogranin A, neuron-specific enolase, bcl-2, and the androgen receptor are modulated during NE differentiation and serve as molecular markers for NE cells. Most importantly, NE cells secrete neuropeptides, such as bombesin, neurotensin, PTHrP, serotonin, and calcitonin, which trigger growth and survival responses in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells. Prostate cancer cell receptors that play a role in these processes include the gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) receptor, neurotensin receptors, and the epidermal growth-factor receptor (EGFR). Signal-transduction molecules activated by these neuropeptides include Src, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), ERK, and PI3K/Akt, with subsequent activation of Elk-1, NF-kappaB, and c-myc transcription factors. A multitude of genes are then expressed by prostate cancer cells, which are involved in proliferation, anti-apoptosis, migration, metastasis, and angiogenesis. Targeting of these pathways at multiple levels can be exploited to inhibit the process by which NE cells contribute to the progression of androgen-independent, treatment-refractory prostate cancer.",

As regulatory factors continue to be identified, the complexity of the molecular mechanisms that control gene expression in osteoblast lineage cells and drive the osteoblast maturation process are being further appreciated. A central regulator of bone formation is the Runx2 (Cbfa1/AML3) transcription factor which fulfills its role as a master regulatory switch through unique properties for mediating the temporal activation and/or repression of cell growth and phenotypic genes as osteoblasts progress through stages of differentiation. This review examines the multifunctional roles of Runx2 during osteogenesis. Runx2 functions as a \"platform protein\" that interacts with a spectrum of coregulatory proteins to provide a combinatorial mechanism for integrating cell signaling pathways required for osteoblast differentiation and the tissue-specific regulation of gene expression. In a broader context, it has recently been appreciated that the Runx1 hematopoietic factor and the Runx3 gene associated with neural and gut development are also expressed in the skeleton, although at present our knowledge of their roles in bone formation is limited. Here we discuss the biological functions of Runx factors in promoting cell fate determination and lineage progression, which include (1) regulating gene activation and repression through coregulatory protein interactions and by supporting chromatin remodeling; (2) integrating ECM signaling and cues from developmental, hormonal, and signal transduction pathways by formation of complexes organized in subnuclear domains; and (3) mediating cell growth control.

Daily intermittent PTH treatment for postmenopausal women results in a dramatic increase in bone mineral density (BMD) (i.e., 10-15% improvement in spine BMD) and a significant decline (i.e., a risk reduction of nearly 2/3) in the occurrence of fragility fractures.

Aneuploidy, the most frequent form of genomic instability in human carcinomas, develops as early as in nonmalignant cervical precursor lesions. In addition, cervical neoplasia is frequently associated with abnormal multipolar mitotic figures, suggesting disturbances of the cell-division process as a mechanism for chromosome segregation defects. Spindle poles are formed by centrosomes, and the high-risk HPV E6 and E7 oncoproteins can each induce abnormal centrosome numbers. These two HPV oncoproteins, however, induce centrosome abnormalities through fundamentally different mechanisms and, presumably, with different functional consequences. High-risk HPV E7, which targets the pRB tumor suppressor pathway, can provoke abnormal centrosome duplication in phenotypically normal cells. On the contrary, cells expressing the HPV E6 oncoprotein, which inactivates p53, accumulate abnormal numbers of centrosomes in parallel with multinucleation and nuclear atypia. These two pathways are not mutually exclusive, since co-expression of HPV E6 and E7 has synergistic effects on centrosome abnormalities and chromosomal instability. Taken together, these findings support the general model in which chromosomal instability arises as a direct consequence of oncogenic insults and can develop at early stages of tumor progression.",

In cells of hematopoietic origin, P2X sub(7) receptor activation has been shown to lead to multiple downstream events, including cytokine release, cell permeabilization, and apoptosis. This receptor has also been implicated in the generation of multinucleated giant cells, polykaryons, and osteoclasts. We have recently demonstrated that a blockade of this receptor inhibits osteoclast formation in vitro; therefore, we examined mice deficient in the P2X sub(7) receptor in the context of bone. These mice were healthy and displayed no overt skeletal problems. Furthermore, we were able to demonstrate their ability to form multinucleated cells, in particular osteoclasts, both in vivo and in vitro. We also demonstrate the ability of P2X sub(7)R super(-/-) multinucleated osteoclasts, upon stimulation with maitotoxin (MTX), to form pores in the plasma membrane in vitro. These findings are consistent with the existence of an endogenous pore structure present in osteoclast precursor cells that can be activated either by the P2X sub(7) receptor, or in its absence, by alternative signals to mediate fusion and pore formation. These data provide further insight into the mode of action of the P2X sub(7) receptor.",

When mouse or human osteoblastic cells were treated with higher concentrations of calcium (6.6 or 8.6 mM in alpha -MEM/10% FBS) than present in control cultures (1.6 mM), the previously well-documented increase in cell number was demonstrated. Cinacalcet HCl affected cell proliferation of CHO cells transfected with CaR, dose dependently, but had no effect on human or mouse osteoblastic cell proliferation in calcium-containing medium (1.6 or 8.6 mM). To test cinacalcet HCl and calcium on osteoclastic cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were cultured in medium containing RANK ligand and M-CSF, supplemented with calcium, and/or cinacalcet HCl. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive multinucleated osteoclastic cells on plastic or bone were then counted at 11 and 21 days, respectively. Calcium (greater than 6.0 mM) inhibited osteoclast formation, but cinacalcet HCl (30-1000 nM) had no effect on osteoclastic formation or resorption in the presence of calcium (1.6 or 6.1 mM). RT-PCR did not detect CaR in human, rat, or mouse primary osteoblastic cells and cell lines or osteoclastic cells. In conclusion, these studies indicate that the calcium-induced increase in osteoblastic cell number, and the decrease in formation/function of osteoclastic cells, involves a mechanism or receptor other than CaR. In addition, the calcimimetic agent did not potentiate the effects of calcium on normal adult human bone cells in vitro.",

Patients and controls were investigated for markers of bone formation and resorption at baseline and following stimulation with thyroid hormone. Moreover, four different well-described murine models of osteopetrosis were investigated. Concerning the human forms, serum TSH levels decreased in all subjects, indicating effects on the target tissue. Osteocalcin and cross-linked collagen (NTx) were without significant differences among the groups. Significant increases in both markers were seen following stimulation. Baseline active TGF- beta 1 levels were increased in both types of ADO (60% in ADO I [P = 0.006]; 46% in ADO II [P = 0.001], respectively), whereas fibronectin levels were decreased in both (ADO I 58% and ADO II 63% of normal, respectively [P = 0.012 and P = 0.001]). Following treatment, levels increased temporarily in all groups. In the murine models, active TGF- beta 1 was significantly decreased in the tl- and ia-rat, whereas fibronectin levels were decreased in the mi-mouse, however, increased in the ia-rat. In conclusion, both types of ADO showed the same qualitative biochemical differences compared to controls, except that OPG levels were higher in ADO I. The decreased fibronectin levels in both types and in murine models reflect decreased bone resorption; however, this may also indicate hitherto unrecognized alterations in bone formation.

In particular, for the majority of skeletal elements to develop and grow, the process of endochondral ossification requires a constantly moving interface between cartilage, invading blood vessels, and bone. A great deal has been learned in recent years about the regulation of chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation by hormones, growth factors, and physiologic stimuli during skeletal development and growth. Likewise, the discovery that colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1, or M-CSF) and receptor activator of NF- Kappa B ligand (RANKL, a tumor necrosis factor superfamily member also called TRANCE, ODF, OPGL, and TNFSF11) are pivotal in communicating from osteoblasts to osteoclasts has led to deeper insights into bone growth, turnover, and maintenance. Little is known, however, about how these two quite different systems communicate to solve the problem of providing integrated, continuous mechanical support during the dynamic invasion of cartilage by bone that characterizes endochondral bone growth. Evidence has accumulated in recent years that provides insight into the communication between growing bone and cartilage in the form of a subset of osteopetrotic mutations, which share a lack of osteoclasts and an accompanying chondrodysplasia of the growth plate. These mutations thus implicate some of the same gene products in regulating chondrocyte differentiation and bone resorption. We also consider expression studies of some known growth plate regulators, such as parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) and Indian hedgehog (Ihh), in light of this and propose a model in which the osteoclastogenic factors act also on chondrocytes, but downstream of PTRrP and Ihh in regulating proliferation and differentiation, and after early morphogenic patterns are established.",

High concentrations of oxalate promote stone formation in two ways: (1) by providing urinary conditions favorable to the formation of calcium oxalate crystals, and (2) by inducing renal injury that generates cellular debris and promotes crystal nucleation and attachment. Oxalate toxicity is mediated in part by activation of lipid signaling pathways that produce arachidonic acid, lysophospholipids, and ceramide. These lipids disrupt mitochondrial function by increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS), decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential, and increasing mitochondrial permeability. The net response is cytochrome C release, activation of caspases, and apoptosis or necrosis. Not all cells succumb to oxalate toxicity, however, in those cells that don't, ROS and lipid-signaling molecules induce changes in gene expression that allow them to survive and adapt to the toxic insult. The increased expression of immediate early genes (IEGs), osteopontin, extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, crystallization inhibitors, and chemokines orchestrates a group of cellular responses--including cell proliferation, secretion of kidney stone inhibitory proteins, recruitment of immune cells, and tissue remodeling--that limit accumulation of cell debris or increase the production of inhibitors of calcium oxalate crystallization, thereby limiting stone formation.",

Here, we review the evidence for osteoblast and osteocyte apoptosis in GC-induced bone disease and highlight current debates: (1) With recent reports describing the antiapoptotic effect of GCs in some in vitro osteoblast models, and with the known adverse effects of GCs on osteoblast cell cycle and differentiation, could the in vivo osteoblast apoptosis be an indirect rather than a direct effect of GCs?

Could the latter be a mere manifestation of the former? and (3) How does apoptosis fit into the traditional concept of ischemia as a key etiology in osteonecrosis?

It is well-established that adult articular cartilage has limited regenerative capacity, and, although numerous treatment protocols are currently employed clinically, few approaches exist that are capable of consistently restoring long-term function to damaged articular cartilage. Tissue engineering strategies that focus on the use of three-dimensional scaffolds for repairing articular cartilage lesions offer many advantages over current treatment strategies. Appropriate design of biodegradable scaffold conduits (either preformed or injectable) allow for the delivery of reparative cells bioactive factors, or gene factors to the defect site in an organized manner. This review seeks to highlight pertinent design considerations and limitations related to the development, material selection, and processing of scaffolds for articular cartilage tissue engineering, evidenced over the last decade. In particular, considerations for novel repair strategies that use scaffolds in combination with controlled release of bioactive factors or gene therapy are discussed, as are scaffold criteria related to mechanical stimulation of cell-seeded constructs. Furthermore, the subsequent impact of current and future aspects of these multidisciplinary scaffold-based approaches related to in vitro and in vivo cartilage tissue engineering are reported herein.",

First, that tumors are heterogeneous populations of cells, and second, that the process is a sequence of events that depends on tumor cell properties and interactions with the microenvironment at the site of metastasis. Inhibitors targeted at any of these different steps have the potential to inhibit metastatic progression, and examples of key therapeutic targets include overexpression of growth factor receptors, angiogenic factors, matrix metalloproteases, and integrin receptors. The identification of molecular targets for therapy of breast cancer metastasis will be accelerated by DNA array technology, and their selection for use should include evaluation of interactions between tumor cells and normal tissue components. These sorts of inhibitors are likely to target both cancer and normal cell functions, for example, inhibitors of matrix metalloproteases that can potentially inhibit both tumor cell invasion and angiogenesis.

Initial studies reported a reduction in bone mineral density in male ERKO alpha mice. More extensive analyses have been puzzling, likely because of compensatory mechanisms in ERKO mice. Furthermore, the existence of a third ER continues to be a potential explanation for some actions of estrogen in bone. Other rodent models, including the testicular feminized mouse and rat, the aromatase knockout mouse, and a rat with a dominant negative ER mutation, have added information regarding estrogen's actions in bone. This review summarizes many reports characterizing available rodent models with genetic alterations relevant to estrogen action. The sum of these reports suggests that the ER beta is not highly protective in bone because loss of its function results in minimal alterations in the skeleton. Furthermore, loss of both the ER alpha and the ER beta does not account for loss of estrogen action in bone, because the impact of DERKO is seemingly not as great as the impact of gonadectomy on the skeleton. Finally, through studies of ERKO mice and other rodent models of altered sex steroid action, it appears that estrogen may be more protective in the skeleton than androgens.",

Although current clinical procedures cannot restore a normal articular surface, there are a growing number of proteins that may be used to augment a repair process, or protect cartilage from degeneration. Because proteins are often difficult to administer effectively, gene therapy approaches are being developed to provide their sustained synthesis at sites of injury or disease. To promote cartilage repair, cDNAs can be targeted to synovium, or cartilage. Gene transfer to the synovium is generally considered more suitable for chondroprotective therapies that rely on expression of large amounts of anti-inflammatory mediators. The delivery of genes to cartilage defects to promote enhanced repair can be performed by either direct administration of gene delivery vectors, or by implantation of genetically modified chondrogenic cells. Variations of these methods have been used to demonstrate that exogenous cDNAs encoding growth factors can be delivered locally to sites of cartilage damage where they are expressed at physiologically relevant levels. Data is beginning to emerge that suggests that delivery and expression of these genes can influence a repair response toward the synthesis of normal articular cartilage in vivo.

The biological function of androgens is exerted by activation of the transcriptional activity of the androgen receptor (AR). The function of the AR in the prostate is largely dependent on AR protein levels and structural integrity of the protein and other transcription activation factors. Based upon the clinical findings that androgen ablation therapy-resistant PCa still expresses AR and the androgen-regulated gene, prostate-specific antigen, a concept is developing that the androgen receptor is critical for androgen-refractory prostate cancer cells. Indeed, because of the alterations detected in the AR gene, many noncognate activators, including estrogen, progesterone, peptide growth factors, and cytokines, are able to induce transactivation of the AR under androgen-depleted conditions. Also, transactivational activity of the AR is often modulated by crosstalk between the AR and other signaling pathways in cancerous prostatic cells. Dysregulation of AR function in prostate cancer results in an abnormal profile of AR-regulated genes, which include cell cycle regulators, transcription factors, and those proteins important for cell survival, lipogenesis, and secretion.

This deficit in bone mass can be replaced, but the time span for restoration exceeds the period of unloading. Changes in blood flow, systemic hormones, and locally produced factors are contributing in a yet undefined way to the response of osteoblastic cells to loading.

In addressing how the nuclear matrix regulates skeletal genes, the authors compare Nmp4, Cbfa1, and YY1 for the purpose of profiling osteoblast nuclear matrix transcription factors. All three proteins contribute to the transcription of ECM genes and partition into the osteoblast nuclear matrix via a nuclear matrix targeting domain. The authors propose that osteoblast nuclear matrix transcription factors involved in ECM regulation generally have the capacity to alter DNA geometry and reciprocally respond to DNA as an allosteric ligand. This may allow these proteins to adapt to the local nuclear architecture and generate the pattern of regulation specified by that architecture via unmasking of the appropriate transactivation domains. Osteoblast nuclear matrix transcription factors may also act as transcriptional adaptor molecules by supporting the formation of higher order protein complexes along target gene promoters. The genes encoding all three proteins considered here have trinucleotide repeat domains, although the significance of this is unclear. There is no canonical nuclear matrix binding motif, but finger-like structures may be suited for anchoring proteins to discrete subnuclear domains.

Considerable sequence and methylation analysis of imprinted genes has revealed a common theme: Regions of allele-specific methylation inherited from the gametes, or primary differentially methylated regions (DMRs), are associated with CpG islands and repeat elements, and this overall structure suggests functional significance. For at least three imprinted genes the sequence of the primary DMR constitutes an element able to regulate gene activity in cis -- a chromatin insulator and a promoter of an antisense transcript. In these cases the unique feature of imprinting appears to be in the ability to switch the regulatory capacity of these elements on or off by the absence or presence of inherited methylation. Increasing evidence therefore suggests that genomic imprinting for at least some genes constitutes the regulation of gene regulatory elements by methylation. An important challenge now is to determine how the differential methylation of primary DMR sequences is established in the germ line. If methylation is the primary imprint, then the processes establishing it are the primary imprinting mechanisms. Trans-acting factors that are expressed in one sex of germ line and not the other are likely to be involved, and their ability to methylate may be mediated through repeat elements associated with the sequence of primary DMRs.",

Osteolytic metastases are incurable and cause pain, hypercalcemia, fracture, and nerve compression syndromes. It was proposed over a century ago that certain cancers, such as that of the breast, preferentially metastasize to the favorable microenvironment provided by bone. Bone matrix is a rich store of immobilized growth factors that are released during bone resorption. Histological analysis of osteolytic bone metastases indicates that the bone destruction is mediated by the osteoclast rather than directly by the tumor cells. These observations suggest a vicious cycle driving the formation of osteolytic metastases: tumor cells secrete factors stimulating osteoclasts through adjacent bone marrow stromal cells; osteoclastic resorption in turn releases growth factors from the bone matrix; finally, locally released growth factors activate the tumor cells. This vicious cycle model has now been confirmed at the molecular level. In particular, transforming growth factor beta (TGF3beta) is abundant in bone matrix and released as a consequence of osteoclastic bone resorption. Bone-derived TGFbeta plays an integral role in promoting the development and progression of osteolytic bone metastases by inducing tumor production of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), a known stimulator of osteoclastic bone resorption. In breast cancer cells TGFbeta appears to stimulate PTHrP secretion by a posttranscriptional mechanism through both Smad and p38 mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling pathways. Osteolytic metastases can be suppressed in vivo by inhibition of bone resorption, blockade of TGFbeta signaling in tumor cells, and by neutralization of PTHrP. Other factors released from bone matrix may also act on tumor cells in bone, which in turn may produce other factors that stimulate bone resorption, following the vicious cycle paradigm established for TGFbeta and PTHrP. An understanding at the molecular level of the mechanisms of osteolytic metastasis will result in more effective therapies for this devastating complication of cancer.",

Several features of this architecture are now well established: 1. Chromosomes occupy distinct territories in the cell nucleus with preferred nuclear locations, although there is no evidence of a rigid suprachromosomal order. 2. Chromosome territories (CTs) in turn contain distinct chromosome arm domains and smaller chromatin foci or domains with diameters of some 300 to 800 nm and a DNA content in the order of 1 Mbp. 3. Gene-dense, early-replicating and gene-poor, middle-to-late-replicating chromatin domains exhibit different higher-order nuclear patterns that persist through all stages of interphase. In mitotic chromosomes early replicating chromatin domains give rise to Giemsa light bands, whereas middle-to-late-replicating domains form Giemsa dark bands and C-bands. In an attempt to integrate these experimental data into a unified view of the functional nuclear architecture, we present a model of a modular and dynamic chromosome territory (CT) organization. We propose that basically three nuclear compartments exist, an \"open\" higher-order chromatin compartment with chromatin domains containing active genes, a \"closed\" chromatin compartment comprising inactive genes, and an interchromatin domain (ICD) compartment (Cremer et al., 1993; Zirbel et al., 1993) that contains macromolecular complexes for transcription, splicing, DNA replication, and repair. Genes in \"open,\" but not in \"closed\" higher-order chromatin compartments have access to transcription and splicing complexes located in the ICD compartment. Chromatin domains that build the \"open\" chromatin compartment are organized in a way that allows the direct contact of genes and nascent RNA to transcription and splicing complexes, respectively, preformed in the ICD compartment. In contrast, chromatin domains that belong to the \"closed\" compartment are topologically arranged and compacted in a way that precludes the accessibility of genes to transcription complexes. We argue that the content of the ICD compartment is highly enriched in DNA depleted biochemical matrix preparations. The ICD compartment may be considered as the structural and functional equivalent of the in vivo nuclear matrix. A matrix in this functional sense is compatible with but does not necessitate the concept of a 3D nuclear skeleton existing of long, extensively arborized filaments. In the absence of unequivocal evidence for such a structural matrix in the nucleus of living cells we keep an agnostic attitude about its existence and possible properties in maintaining the higher-order nuclear architecture. Quantitative modeling of the 3D and 4D human genome architecture in situ shows that such an assumption is not necessary to explain presently known aspects of the higher-order nuclear architecture. We expect that the interplay of quantitative modeling and experimental tests will result in a better understanding of the compartmentalized nuclear architecture and its functional consequences.",

Hybridization studies with a subgroup of clones (about one-sixth of the total clones in this library) showed that many of them were highlighted by probes prepared from early replicating DNA, as well as from nuclear matrix-associated DNA. Statistical analysis showed a positive correlation between these hybridization results. We seek to identify origins of replication that are activated early in the S phase of the cell cycle in human cells. Therefore, clones isolated from this library are being analyzed for the presence of structural motifs that have been found in other origins of replication and for potential sites of attachment to the nuclear matrix. This method of analysis is illustrated here using the published sequences for the origins of replication reported for the human lamin B2 and HPRT genes.",

Moreover, a rational approach to therapeutic interventions that might alter the clinical course of bone disorders must take into consideration the exact nature of the developmental control mechanism(s) being affected during the disease process. The process of osteopoiesis involves the proliferation and maturation of primitive precursor cells into functional osteoblasts. The bone cell lineage originates from mesenchymal stem cells that commit to the osteogenic cell lineage becoming osteoprogenitor cells, preosteoblasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes. In order to understand how different regulatory signals coordinate bone cell development, it is important to study the responses of bone progenitor cells to different microenvironmental signals. This requires that lineage markers be identified for the various populations of bone cells and their precursors, that cell separation techniques be established so that cells of the osteogenic lineage can be purified at different stages of differentiation, and that these isolated cells are studied under serum-free, chemically defined conditions. This review focuses on the current understanding of bone progenitor cell development, examining the various types of precursor cells, their responses to cytokines and other extracellular influences, and recent observations on the biochemical and molecular control of lineage-specific gene expression. Although the emphasis is on human cells, the importance of work using rodent cells goes without saying, and is addressed where relevant.",

Both coronary and aortic calcification are common and influence plaque rupture, angioplasty and surgical complications, and compensatory enlargement. Aortic calcification increases aortic rigidity and contributes to cadiac ischemia, left ventricular hypertrophy, heart failure, and stroke. Calcification is also common in aortic valve leaflets further compounding adverse hemodynamic effects. Vascular calcification has often been attributed to \"passive\" crystallization. However, functional similarities between atherosclerotic lesions and bone contradict this view and indicate that it is no more \"passive\" than in embryonic bone formation or bone repair. Similarities include presence of all the major components of bone osteoid, bone regulatory factors, and subpopulations of artery wall cells that retain osteoblastic lineage potential. Several animal models for vascular calcification are available. Spontaneous vascular calcification occurs in null mice for matrix GLA protein (MGP), a small matrix protein of unknown function, and osteoprotegerin (OPG), known to modulate osteoclast differentiation. Vascular calcification may also be induced by feeding vitamin D and calcium or warfarin to normal animals, or by fat-feeding mice null for apoE or the LDL-receptor. Overall, regulation of vascular calcification is a growing field with surprising mechanisms and connections to other fields of biology.",

NPC structure is conserved, flexible, and is not simply a tunnel between the nucleus and cytoplasm but appears to be actively involved in the transport process by a series of structural modifications. Transport through the NPC begins in either of its asymmetrical peripheral compartments that are both structurally reorganized during transport in different ways. The central compartment is composed of two symmetrical halves, and functions as a system of transiently open, discrete gates that is not believed to play a role in determining direction. Each NPC subunit has a specific morphology that corresponds to the functional role it plays. A complicated system of vertical and horizontal connections may allow one part of the NPC to transmit a signal to other parts, leading to an ordered series of conformational changes that drive translocation. High-resolution scanning electron microscopy has identified sequential stages of NPC assembly in vitro and revealed how the individual NPC components are assembled into a mature NPC. This review focuses on structural events during transport and on possible mechanisms of NPC assembly.",

Eliminated or restricted blood flow to tissues as a result of vessel dysfunction results in the disruption of oxygen and nutrient delivery and the accumulation of waste metabolites. Cells cannot survive extended severe ischemia but may be able to adapt to a moderate condition where diffusion to and from bordering nonischemic regions sustain vital functions. Under this condition, secondary functions of affected cells are likely to be impaired and a new metabolic equilibrium is established, determined by the level of cross-diffusion. In tissues with a normally high metabolic turnover such as skeletal and cardiac muscle, ischemia causes hypoxia, acidosis, and depressed function (contractility). The treatment possibilities for tissue ischemia resulting from vascular disease are limited. Lipid-lowering agents may help slow the progression of vessel disease in some instances, but surgical reconstruction may be the only option in advanced stages, and even this is not always an option. An alternative and rather obvious strategy to treat ischemia is to activate endogenous angiogenic or vasculogenic pathways and stimulate revascularization of the tissue. The feasibility of such a strategy has now been established through the results of studies over the past decade and a new discipline called therapeutic angiogenesis has emerged. This review focuses on the application of therapeutic angiogenesis for treating peripheral limb ischemia and coronary artery diseases; the author traces the evidence supporting the feasibility of this treatment strategy, its current limitations, and possible directions.",

PTH is secreted by the parathyroids and functions in an endocrine manner to regulate extracellular fluid calcium concentrations, largely by interacting with receptors expressed in kidney and bone. PTHrP, on the other hand, is widely expressed and acts by autocrine or paracrine signaling to modulate a range of physiological and developmental responses. PTH1R1 signaling is required both in the adult and during development, and ablation of PTHR1 gene expression results in an embryonic lethal phenotype in both mice and humans. Consequently, the PTHR1 is widely expressed, and transcription of its gene is tissue specific and developmentally regulated. This review focuses on our current knowledge of the mechanisms controlling expression of the PTHR1 gene in humans and in rodents, both during development and in the adult. We also compare the conserved and distinct aspects of PTHR1 gene regulation in the two systems and their bearing on signaling by PTH and PTHrP.",

Extracellular signals, including the binding of extracellular matrix and soluble molecules to cell membrane receptors, activate specific signal transducers that process information inside the cell leading to alteration in gene expression. Some of these transducers when translocated to the cell nucleus may bind to transcription complexes and thereby modify the transcriptional activity of specific genes. However, the basic molecules involved in the regulation of gene expression are found in many different cell and tissue types; thus, the mechanisms underlying tissue-specific gene expression are still obscure. In this review we focus on the study of signals that are conveyed to the nucleus. We propose that the way in which extracellular signals are integrated may account for tissue-specific gene expression. We argue that the integration of signals depends on the nature of the structural organization of cells (i.e., extracellular matrix, membrane proteins, cytoskeleton, nucleus) that defines a particular cell type within a tissue. Thus, gene expression can be envisioned as being regulated by the mutual influence of extracellular and intracellular organizations, i.e., in context.",

Small regions possessing high base unpairing potential within these MARs are referred to as base unpairing regions (BURs). BUR-affinity chromatographic separations of proteins from breast cancer cells yielded, almost exclusively, a mixture of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), two nuclear enzymes that are implicated in the cellular response to DNA damage. Contrary to the longheld notion that PARP and Ku autoantigen, the DNA-binding heterodimeric subunit of DNA-PK, bind only to DNA ends, recently we have shown that both proteins individually bind BURs with high affinity and specificity in an end-independent manner. Furthermore, Ku autoantigen forms a molecular complex with PARP in the absence of DNA, and the physical association of these proteins synergistically enhanced their BUR-binding activity. Autoribosylation of PARP abolished its association with Ku autoantigen and BUR-binding activity. These findings have, for the first time, provided a molecular link toward elucidating the functional interaction between PARP and DNA-PK. The identification of MARs as their common binding target suggests a novel role for these enzymes in the modulation of chromatin structure and function.",
