Dynamic and reversible palmitoylation controls a wide range of molecular and cellular properties of proteins including the protein trafficking, protein function, protein stability, and specialized membrane domain organization. However, technical difficulties in (1) detection of palmitoylated substrate proteins and (2) purification and enzymology of palmitoylating enzymes have prevented the progress in palmitoylation research, compared with that in phosphorylation research. The recent development of proteomic and chemical biology techniques has unexpectedly expanded the known complement of palmitoylated proteins in various species and tissues/cells, and revealed the unique occurrence of palmitoylated proteins in membrane-bound organelles and specific membrane compartments. Furthermore, identification and characterization of DHHC (Asp-His-His-Cys) palmitoylating enzyme-substrate pairs have contributed to elucidating the regulatory mechanisms and pathophysiological significance of protein palmitoylation.

Despite decades of intensive studies in industry and academia, atomic mechanisms of action are still not completely understood. The major cause is a lack of high-resolution structures of eukaryotic channels and their complexes with ligands. In these circumstances a useful approach is homology modeling that employs as templates X-ray structures of potassium channels and prokaryotic sodium channels. On one hand, due to inherent limitations of this approach, results should be treated with caution. In particular, models should be tested against relevant experimental data. On the other hand, docking of drugs and toxins in homology models provides a unique possibility to integrate diverse experimental data provided by mutational analysis, electrophysiology, and studies of structure-activity relations. Here we describe how homology modeling advanced our understanding of mechanisms of several classes of ligands. These include tetrodotoxins and mu-conotoxins that block the outer pore, local anesthetics that block of the inner pore, batrachotoxin that binds in the inner pore but, paradoxically, activates the channel, pyrethroid insecticides that activate the channel by binding at lipid-exposed repeat interfaces, and scorpion alpha and beta-toxins, which bind between the pore and voltage-sensing domains and modify the channel gating.

Depolarization of the cell membrane causes VGSCs to open but also gives rise to a nonconducting state termed inactivation. Inactivation of VGSCs serves a critical physiologic function as it determines the extent of excitability of neurons and of muscle cells. Depending on the time course of development and removal of inactivation both \"fast-\" and \"slow\"-inactivated states have been described. Evidence from mutagenesis studies suggests that fast inactivation is produced by a block of the internal vestibule by a tethered inactivation particle that has been mapped to the internal linker between domains III and IV. The motion of this linker may be regulated by parts of the internal C-terminus. The molecular mechanism of slow inactivation is less clear. However, aside from a high number of mutagenesis studies, the recent availability of 3D structures of crystallized prokaryotic VGSCs offers insights into the molecular motions associated with slow inactivation. One possible scenario is that slow movements of the voltage sensors are transmitted to the external vestibule giving rise to a conformational change of this region.

Fast Nav inactivation (a voltage-independent process) is so tightly coupled, kinetically speaking, to the inherently voltage-dependent process of fast activation that when bleb damage accelerates and thus left-shifts macroscopic fast activation, fast inactivation accelerates to the same extent. The coupled g(V) and availability(V) processes and their window conductance regions consequently left-shift by the same number of millivolts. These damage-induced hyperpolarizing shifts, whose magnitude increases with damage intensity, are called coupled left shift (CLS). Based on past work and modeling, we discuss how to test for Nav-CLS, emphasizing the virtue of sawtooth ramp clamp. We explain that it is the inherent mechanosensitivity of Nav activation that underlies Nav-CLS. Using modeling of excitability, we show the known process of Nav-CLS is sufficient to predict a wide variety of \"sick excitable cell\" phenomena, from hyperexcitability through to depolarizing block. When living cells are mimicked by inclusion of pumps, mild Nav-CLS produces a wide array of burst phenomena and subthreshold oscillations. Dynamical analysis of mild damage scenarios shows how these phenomena reflect changes in spike thresholds as the pumps try to counteract the leaky Nav channels. Smart Nav inhibitors designed for sick excitable cells would target bleb-damaged membrane, buying time for cell-mediated removal or repair of Nav-bearing membrane that has become bleb-damaged (ie, detached from the cytoskeleton).",

Here we review the numerous simulation studies of Na(+) permeation and selectivity in bacterial Nav channels published in the past 5years. These studies use a variety of simulation methodologies differing in force field parameters, molecular models, sampling algorithms, and simulation times. Although results disagree on the details of ion permeation mechanisms, they concur in the presence of two primary Na(+) binding sites in the selectivity filter and support a loosely coupled knock-on mechanism of Na(+) permeation. Comparative studies of Na(+), K(+), and Ca(2+) permeation reveal sites within Nav channels that are Na(+) selective, yet a consensus model of selectivity has not been established. We discuss the agreement between simulation and experimental results and propose strategies that may be used to resolve discrepancies between simulation studies in order to improve future computational studies of permeation and selectivity in ion channels.",

In heart tissue, changes in Na(+) currents can affect conduction velocity and impulse propagation. The cardiac Nav1.5 is also involved in determination of the action potential duration, since some channels may reopen during the plateau phase, generating a persistent or late inward current. Mutations of cardiac Nav1.5 can induce gain or loss of channel function because of an increased late current or a decrease of peak current, respectively. Gain-of-function mutations cause Long QT syndrome type 3 and possibly atrial fibrillation, while loss-of-function channel mutations are associated with a wider variety of phenotypes, such as Brugada syndrome, cardiac conduction disease, dilated cardiomyopathy, and sick sinus node syndrome. The penetrance and phenotypes resulting from Nav1.5 mutations also vary with age, gender, body temperature, circadian rhythm, and between regions of the heart. This phenotypic variability makes it difficult to correlate genotype-phenotype. We propose that mutations are only one contributor to the phenotype and additional modifications on Nav1.5 lead to the phenotypic variability. Possible modifiers include other genetic variations and alterations in the life cycle of Nav1.5 such as gene transcription, RNA processing, translation, posttranslational modifications, trafficking, complex assembly, and degradation. In this chapter, we summarize potential modifiers of cardiac Nav1.5 that could help explain the clinically observed phenotypic variability.

Despite belonging to unrelated lineages, both the predators and prey have independently evolved remarkably similar physiological mechanisms of resistance to TTX that involve chemical and structural changes in voltage-gated sodium channels (NaV). The evolution of TTX resistance in this predator-prey pair constitutes a natural experiment that allows us to explore the causes of molecular convergence. Here, we review broad patterns of convergence at the level of amino acid changes in NaV channels of animals that evolved TTX resistance and make comparisons to known TTX-resistant channels that did not evolve under the selective pressures imposed by TTX. We conclude that convergence likely stems from the interplay of the target specificity of TTX and functional constraints of NaV that are shared among taxa. These and other factors can limit channel evolution to favor a few functionally permissible paths of adaptation, which can explain the observed predictability of changes to channel structure. By studying the functional causes of convergence in NaV channels, we can further our understanding of the role of these important channel proteins at the center of the evolution of the nervous system.",

Ankyrins coordinate functionally related membrane transporters and cell adhesion proteins (15 protein families identified so far) within plasma membrane compartments through independently evolved interactions of intrinsically disordered sequences with a highly conserved peptide-binding groove formed by the ANK repeat solenoid. Ankyrins are coupled to spectrins, which are elongated organelle-sized proteins that form mechanically resilient arrays through cross-linking by specialized actin filaments. In addition to protein interactions, cellular targeting and assembly of spectrin/ankyrin domains also critically depend on palmitoylation of ankyrin-G by aspartate-histidine-histidine-cysteine 5/8 palmitoyltransferases, as well as interaction of beta-2 spectrin with phosphoinositide lipids. These lipid-dependent spectrin/ankyrin domains are not static but are locally dynamic and determine membrane identity through opposing endocytosis of bulk lipids as well as specific proteins. A partnership between spectrin, ankyrin, and cell adhesion molecules first emerged in bilaterians over 500 million years ago. Ankyrin and spectrin may have been recruited to plasma membranes from more ancient roles in organelle transport. The basic bilaterian spectrin-ankyrin toolkit markedly expanded in vertebrates through gene duplications combined with variation in unstructured intramolecular regulatory sequences as well as independent evolution of ankyrin-binding activity by ion transporters involved in action potentials and calcium homeostasis. In addition, giant vertebrate ankyrins with specialized roles in axons acquired new coding sequences by exon shuffling. We speculate that early axon initial segments and epithelial lateral membranes initially were based on spectrin-ankyrin-cell adhesion molecule assemblies and subsequently served as \"incubators,\" where ion transporters independently acquired ankyrin-binding activity through positive selection.",

Within the time frame of milliseconds, this gate closes and blocks the channel pore from conducting any more sodium ions.

New high-resolution X-ray structures for bacterial sodium channels have created an opportunity to see how these proteins operate at the molecular level. An important challenge to overcome is establishing relationships between the structures and functions of mammalian and bacterial channels. Bacterial sodium channels are known to exhibit the main structural features of their mammalian counterparts, as well as several key functional characteristics, including selective ion conduction, voltage-dependent gating, pore-based inactivation and modulation by local anesthetic, antiarrhythmic and antiepileptic drugs. Simulations have begun to shed light on each of these features in the past few years. Despite deviations in selectivity signatures for bacterial and mammalian channels, simulations have uncovered the nature of the multiion conduction mechanism associated with Na(+) binding to a high-field strength site established by charged glutamate side chains. Simulations demonstrated a surprising level of flexibility of the protein, showing that these side chains are active participants in the permeation process. They have also uncovered changes in protein structure, leading to asymmetrical collapses of the activation gate that have been proposed to correspond to inactivated structures. These observations offer the potential to examine the mechanisms of state-dependent drug activity, focusing on pore-blocking and pore-based slow inactivation in bacterial channels, without the complexities of inactivation on multiple timescales seen in eukaryotic channels. Simulations have provided molecular views of the interactions of drugs, consistent with sites predicted in mammalian channels, as well as a wealth of other sites as potential new drug targets. In this chapter, we survey the new insights into sodium channel function that have emerged from studies of simpler bacterial channels, which provide an excellent learning platform, and promising avenues for mechanistic discovery and pharmacological development.",

Located in the first 50m of the axon, it contains unique cytoskeletal features and concentrates a repertoire of specific scaffold and membrane proteins that assembles just after axon determination. The axon initial segment (AIS) supports two crucial physiological functions of the mature neuron: first, it generates and shapes the action potential. Second, it separates the cell body from the axon, preserving the molecular identity of each compartment. In addition to a diffusion barrier restricting membrane proteins and lipids exchange, an intracellular filter has been proposed that could selectively exclude somatodendritic vesicles and recruit axonal cargoes. Finally, the AIS scaffold is capable of morphological plasticity during development or in response to network activity. These changes directly impact the neuron excitability, allowing an adaptive and homeostatic response. These plastic electrogenic properties, as well as the regulation of protein transport to and from the axon, may have important implications in several neuropathological contexts where the AIS structure is altered.

However, several key limitations remain in making adequate dietary recommendations on n-3 PUFAs in addition to translating the fatty acids into clinical trials for select diseases. One major constraint is an incomplete understanding of the underlying mechanisms of action of n-3 PUFAs. In this review, we highlight studies to show n-3 PUFA acyl chains reorganize the molecular architecture of plasma membrane sphingolipid-cholesterol-enriched lipid rafts and potentially sphingolipid-rich cholesterol-free domains and cardiolipin-protein scaffolds in the inner mitochondrial membrane. We also discuss the possibility that the effects of n-3 PUFAs on membrane organization could be regulated by the presence of vitamin E (-tocopherol), which is necessary to protect highly unsaturated acyl chains from oxidation. Finally, we propose the integrated hypothesis, based predominately on studies in lymphocytes, cancer cells, and model membranes, that the mechanism by which n-3 PUFAs disrupt signaling microclusters is highly dependent on the type of lipid species that incorporate n-3 PUFA acyl chains.

They are directly activated by heat or cold in physiologically relevant temperature ranges, and the activation is exquisitely sensitive to temperature changes. Thermodynamically, this strong temperature dependence of thermal channels occurs due to large enthalpy and entropy changes associated with channel opening.

The general structure of these channels is closely related to that of the voltage-dependent K(+) channels, with their subunits containing six transmembrane segments that form tetramers. Thermal TRP channels are polymodal receptors. That is, they can be activated by temperature, voltage, pH, lipids, and agonists. The high temperature sensitivity in these thermal TRP channels is due to a large enthalpy change (100 kcal/mol), which is about five times the enthalpy change in voltage-dependent gating. The characterization of the macroscopic currents and single-channel analysis demonstrated that gating by temperature is complex and best described by branched or allosteric models containing several closed and open states.

The majority of MCs characterized so far catalyzes strict exchanges of substrates across the mitochondrial inner membrane. The substrates are nucleotides, metabolic intermediates, and cofactors that are required in cytoplasmic and matrix metabolism. This review summarizes and discusses the current knowledge of the antiport mechanism(s) of MCs that has been deduced from determining transport characteristics and by analyzing structural, sequence, and mutagenesis data. The mode of transport varies among different MCs with respect to how the substrate translocation depends on the electrical and pH gradients across the mitochondrial inner membrane, for example, the ADP/ATP carrier is electrogenic (electrophoretic), the GTP/GDP carrier is dependent on the pH gradient, the aspartate/glutamate carrier is dependent on both, and the oxoglutarate/malate carrier is independent of them. The structure of the bovine ADP/ATP carrier consists of a six-transmembrane -helix bundle with a pseudo-threefold symmetry and a closed matrix gate. By using this structure as a template in homology modeling, residues engaged in substrate binding and the formation of a cytoplasmic gate in MCs have been proposed. The functional importance of the residues of the binding site, the matrix, and the cytoplasmic gates is supported by transport activities of different MCs with single point mutations.

Their primary function is to mediate the 1:1 exchange of Na+ for H+ across the membrane in which they reside, and they play central roles in regulation of body, cellular, and organellar pH. Their function is tightly regulated through mechanisms involving interactions with multiple protein and lipid-binding partners, phosphorylations, and other posttranslational modifications. Biochemical and mutational analyses indicate that the SLC9As have a short intracellular N-terminus, 12 transmembrane (TM) helices necessary and sufficient for ion transport, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic tail region with essential regulatory roles. No high-resolution structures of the SLC9As exist; however, models based on crystal structures of the bacterial NhaAs support the 12 TM organization and suggest that TMIV and XI may form a central part of the ion-translocation pathway, whereas pH sensing may involve TMII, TMIX, and several intracellular loops. Similar to most ion transporters studied, SLC9As likely exist as coupled dimers in the membrane, and this appears to be important for the well-studied cooperativity of H+ binding. The aim of this work is to summarize and critically discuss the currently available evidence on the structural dynamics, regulation, and binding partner interactions of SLC9As, focusing in particular on the most widely studied isoform, SLC9A1/NHE1.

Clinically relevant antifolates such as methotrexate (MTX) are transported by RFC, and the loss of RFC transport is an important mechanism of MTX resistance. PCFT is abundantly expressed in human tumors and is active under pH conditions associated with the tumor microenvironment. Pemetrexed (PMX) is an excellent substrate for PCFT as well as for RFC. Novel tumor-targeted antifolates related to PMX with selective membrane transport by PCFT over RFC are being developed. The molecular picture of RFC and PCFT continues to evolve relating to membrane topology, N-glycosylation, energetics, and identification of structurally and functionally important domains and amino acids. The molecular bases for MTX resistance associated with loss of RFC function, and for the rare autosomal recessive condition, hereditary folate malabsorption (HFM), attributable to mutant PCFT, have been established. From structural homologies to the bacterial transporters GlpT and LacY, homology models were developed for RFC and PCFT, enabling new mechanistic insights and experimentally testable hypotheses. RFC and PCFT exist as homo-oligomers, and evidence suggests that homo-oligomerization of RFC and PCFT monomeric proteins may be important for intracellular trafficking and/or transport function. Better understanding of the structure and function of RFC and PCFT should facilitate the rational development of new therapeutic strategies for cancer as well as for HFM.",

Transporters in the SLC22 family--all of which are members of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) of transporters--represent a mechanistically diverse set of processes, including the organic anion transporters (OATs and URAT1) that physiologically operate as organic anion (OA) exchangers, the organic cation transporters (OCTs) that operate as electrogenic uniporters of organic cations (OCs), and the so-called \"novel\" organic cation transporters (OCTNs) that support Na-cotransport of selected zwitterions. Whereas the OCTNs display a high degree of substrate selectivity, the physiological hallmark of the OATs and OCTs is their multiselectivity--consistent with a principal role in renal and hepatic clearance of a wide array of both endogenous and xenobiotic compounds. SLC47 consists of members of the multidrug and toxin extruder (MATE) family, which are carriers that are obligatory exchangers and that physiologically support electroneutral H+ exchange. The MATEs also display a characteristic multiselectivity and are frequently paired with OCTs to mediate transepithelial OC secretion, with the OCTs typically supporting basolateral OC entry and the MATEs supporting apical OC efflux. The SLC44 family contains the choline transporter-like (CTL) transporters. Largely restricted to choline and a limited set of structural congeners, the CTLs appear to support the Na-independent, electrogenic uniport of choline, thereby providing choline for membrane biogenesis.

Its contribution is based on the combined action of different adhesion receptors involved in subsequent steps of the process that are assisted by membrane organizers and cytoskeletal-associated components. In this regard, endothelial adhesion receptors congregate in constitutive submicrometer-sized clusters termed endothelial adhesive platforms (EAPs), instead of being randomly distributed throughout the endothelial apical plasma membrane. The organizing units of such platforms are tetraspanin proteins, which interact among themselves and simultaneously with a broad variety of adhesion molecules, providing the adequate receptor avidity to overcome the threshold of adhesion required for leukocyteendothelium interactions occurring under shear flow. Therefore, these adhesive platforms act as a supramolecular mechanism to spatiotemporally organize receptors with similar characteristics and functions at the plasma membrane to facilitate their efficient coordinated action during the process of extravasation, which requires rapid kinetics. This chapter describes the specific characteristics of tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (TEMs) in comparison with other types of membrane domains that make them well suited to organize endothelial receptors during extravasation, orchestrating the adhesion cascade on the endothelial side.

Integrin-mediated leukocyte adhesion and migration constitute the essential component in immune system, as exemplified by a group of genetic disorders leukocyte adhesion deficiencies (LAD) type I and III. The most unique feature of integrins is that they transmit the bidirectional signals across the plasma membrane. In response to internal cues (e.g., activation of chemokine receptor and T-cell receptor that elicit intracellular signaling cascades) that impinge on the integrin cytoplasmic domains, the integrin extracellular part undergoes the global conformational changes, rapidly upregulating the ability to bind ligand. Conversely, in response to external cues (e.g., ligand binding and shear force) applied to the extracellular part, the integrin cytoplasmic domains change their configuration, thereby altering the ability to interact with intracellular signaling molecules that regulate gene expression and cell metabolism. This unique ability of integrins stems from the regulated conformational dynamism between the low-affinity bent to the high-affinity extended integrin. The point of equilibrium of the integrin conformational dynamism is determined by a balance of the internal and external cues, as well as the activation threshold set by the intra- and interdomain interactions within the integrin molecule.",

These structures have been well characterized in pure lipid systems and in red blood cells, where the process of tether formation can take place under well-defined conditions. From those studies, detailed mechanical descriptions of the process have been validated and fundamental physical properties of the membrane bilayer and the strength of its association with the underlying cytoskeleton have been characterized. The dynamics of tether formation can be characterized in terms of an effective viscosity coefficient that relates the dynamic force contribution to the rate of tether formation. More detailed mechanical analysis reveals that the effective viscosity is expected to scale as the square of the tether radius, which in turn decreases with increasing force. This leads to lower apparent viscosities at higher rates of tether formation and the appearance of shear thinning, even though the drag coefficient that characterizes the rate-dependent force generated from interactions between the bilayer and the cytoskeleton remains constant. Tether formation from leukocytes has been found to be an important modulating factor in the rolling adhesive interactions between leukocytes and endothelium, where they act to prolong bond lifetime and maintain cellcell contact. It is anticipated that properly accounting for the physical characteristics of tether formation will help lead to reliable predictions of cell behavior as they roll along and are detached from adhesive substrates.",

For cells to tether, interactions between adhesion molecules must form rapidly. For cells to roll, these interactions must break rapidly. Rolling adhesion on vascular surfaces is the first step in recruiting circulating leukocytes to secondary lymphoid organs or to sites of infection or injury. Rolling requires the rapid yet balanced formation and dissociation of adhesive bonds in the challenging environment of blood flow. This chapter explores how selectins interact through mechanically regulated kinetics with their ligands to meet these challenges. Remarkably, increasing force applied to adhesive bonds first prolongs their lifetimes (catch bonds) and then shortens their lifetimes (slip bonds). Catch bonds mediate the counterintuitive phenomenon of flow-enhanced rolling adhesion. Force-regulated disruptions of receptor interdomain or intradomain interactions remote from the ligand-binding surface generate catch bonds. Adhesion receptor dimerization, clustering in membrane domains and interactions with the cytoskeleton, modulate the forces applied to bonds.",

Accumulating data suggest that these integrins acquire high affinity to these endothelial ligands in a process tightly regulated by a variety of cytoskeletal conformational changes in their - and -subunits. These alterations are controlled by inside-out signals that are induced primarily by chemokines displayed on the endothelium and transduced by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) on the responding leukocytes. The GPCR signals can propagate within milliseconds at submicron ranges. Upon binding their ligands, GPCR-stimulated integrins also undergo outside-in conformational activation, which is accelerated by applied forces. The integrin activator, talina universal cytoskeletal adaptor in integrinmediated focal adhesionsplays an instrumental role in this bidirectional activation process, which is critical for leukocyte arrest on endothelial IgSF ligands. Multiple effectors in the immediate vicinity to integrintalin complexes can determine the extent to which talin may translate a given chemokine signal into a fully productive integrin activation. Substantial heterogeneity exists in the pathways used by different cell types to translate a given combination of chemokines and integrin ligands into leukocyte arrest and subsequent adhesion strengthening on various target endothelia.

Leukocytes travel around the human body through circulatory vessels that are lined with Endothelial cells (ECs). When they leave blood, leukocytes roll on ECs first. This is due, in part, to weak adhesive interactions mediated mainly by selectins on both leukocytes and ECs. This weak adhesion, coupled with the force and torque imposed on the leukocyte by blood flow, yields a consecutive series of jerky motion of the leukocyte, often coined rolling. Neutrophil and lymphocyte rolling are essential for their immunological functions, whereas monocyte rolling is critical for its arrest on the vascular wall and invasion into the aortic intima. Leukocyte rolling on the endothelium is the first critical step of leukocyte migration to sites of infection, injury, or atherosclerotic lesions. Unstable rolling impairs effective neutrophil and lymphocyte recruitment to infected tissues and renders human beings defenseless against invading microorganisms, resulting in immunological diseases, such as leukocyte adhesion deficiency syndrome. On the other hand, stable rolling is critical for monocyte infiltration into the aortic intima that initiates and exacerbates cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis. Elucidating the mechanisms that underlie leukocyte rolling can pave the way toward therapeutic amelioration of such maladies. However, the rolling of leukocytes is a complex dynamic process that is mediated concertedly by adhesion molecules expressed on leukocytes and ECs, shear stress due to blood flow, and mechanical properties of leukocytes and ECs.

A core spectrinankyrin mechanism for coordinating membrane-spanning proteins and mechanically stabilizing membrane bilayers was expanded in vertebrates by gene duplication events, insertion of giant alternately spliced exons of axonal ankyrins, and a versatile peptide-binding fold of ANK repeats that facilitated acquisition of new protein partners. Cell adhesion molecules (CAM), including dystroglycan, L1 CAM family members, and cadherins, are the earliest examples of membrane-spanning proteins with ankyrin-binding motifs and were all present in urochordates. In contrast, ion channels have continued to evolve ankyrin-binding sites in vertebrates. These considerations suggest a model where proto-domains formed through interaction of ankyrin and spectrin with CAMs. These proto-domains then became populated with ion channels that developed ankyrin-binding activity with selective pressure provided by optimization of physiological function.

In most cells studied so far, SNAREs are not randomly distributed across the plasma membrane but are clustered and segregated in discrete membrane domains of defined size, composition, and stability. SNARE clusters have been intensively studied for more than a decade. Different mechanisms have been proposed to be responsible for SNARE clustering such as partitioning into cholesterol-enriched lipid rafts, hydrophobic mismatch, posttranslational modifications of the SNAREs including phosphorylation and palmitoylation, electrostatic proteinprotein and proteinlipid interactions, homotypic and heterotypic protein interactions, and anchoring to the cortical cytoskeleton. Although several of these proposed mechanisms are still controversially discussed, it is becoming apparent that independent physicochemical principles must cooperate in a synergistic manner to yield SNARE microdomains. Here, we discuss the architecture and function of SNARE domains.

Search for the molecular components of SOCE channels led to the identification of mammalian transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) family of calcium-permeable channels (TRPC1-TRPC7), which are all activated in response to stimuli that result in PIP2 hydrolysis. While several TRPCs, including TRPC1, TRPC3, and TRPC4, have been implicated in SOCE, the data are most consistent for TRPC1. Extensive studies in cell lines and knockout mouse models have established the contribution of TRPC1 to SOCE. Furthermore, there is a critical functional interaction between TRPC1 and the key components of SOCE, STIM1, and Orai1, which determines the activation of TRPC1. Orai1-mediated Ca(2+) entry is required for recruitment of TRPC1 and its insertion into surface membranes while STIM1 gates the channel. Notably, TRPC1 and Orai1 generate distinct patterns of Ca(2+) signals in cells that are decoded for the regulation of specific cellular functions. Thus, SOCE appears to be a complex process that depends on temporal and spatial coordination of several distinct steps mediated by proteins in different cellular compartments. Emerging data suggest that, in many cell types, the net Ca(2+) entry measured in response to store depletion is the result of the coordinated regulation of different calcium-permeable ion channels. Orai1 and STIM1 are central players in this process, and by mediating recruitment or activation of other Ca(2+) channels, Orai1-CRAC function can elicit rapid changes in global and local [Ca(2+)]i signals in cells. It is most likely that the type of channels and the [Ca(2+)]i signature that are generated by this process reflect the physiological function of the cell that is regulated by Ca(2+).",

This chapter provides a historical perspective and critical analysis of the biochemistry, structure, and physiological functions of this actin filament network in RBCs. The core units of this network are nodes of ~3537nm-long actin filaments, interconnected by long strands of (11)2-spectrin tetramers, forming a 2D isotropic lattice with quasi-hexagonal symmetry. Actin filament length and stability is critical for network formation, relying upon filament capping at both ends: tropomodulin-1 at pointed ends and -adducin at barbed ends. Tropomodulin-1 capping is essential for precise filament lengths, and is enhanced by tropomyosin, which binds along the short actin filaments. -adducin capping recruits spectrins to sites near barbed ends, promoting network formation. Accessory proteins, 4.1R and dematin, also promote spectrin binding to actin and, with -adducin, link to membrane proteins, targeting actin nodes to the membrane. Dissection of the molecular organization within the RBC membrane skeleton is one of the paramount achievements of cell biological research in the past century.

Several methods can be used to distinguish among the various modes of protein mobility, including fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, single-particle tracking, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, and variations of these techniques. Here, we present both a brief overview of these methods and examples of their use to elucidate the dynamics of membrane proteins in mammalian cellsfirst in erythrocytes, then in erythroblasts and other cells in the hematopoietic lineage, and finally in non-hematopoietic cells. This multisystem analysis shows that the cytoskeleton frequently governs modes of membrane protein motion by stably anchoring the proteins through direct-binding interactions, by restricting protein diffusion through steric interactions, or by facilitating directed protein motion.

The CCCs are inhibited by clinically relevant drugs, including loop diuretics that inhibit NKCC2 in the renal thick ascending limb and thiazide diuretics that inhibit NCC in the renal distal tubule. For many years, much research on this gene family has centered on understanding ion binding and inhibitor interaction which represent important features of the molecular operation of these transporters. Recently, high resolution structures of bacterial transport proteins related to the CCCs have become available, thus permitting structural context in which to evaluate previous ion and inhibitor studies of the CCCs. In this article, I review past molecular and structurefunction studies that have provided key pieces of information about ion binding and inhibitor interaction primarily of NKCC for which we have the most information. I then place these findings into the structural context of recent homology models of NKCC based on the outward-facing open and occluded conformations of the related bacterial transporters. These homology models provide our first glimpse into the fine details of the molecular operation of the CCCs.",

The first human zinc importer was identified in 2000. Since that time, a new family of proteins, named ZIP, for Zrt-, Irt-like proteins, has been shown to be expressed in a tissue-specific manner in humans. There are a total of 14 members of this family, which can be further divided into four subfamilies based on sequence similarities: ZIPI, ZIPII, gufA and LIV-1. It has been shown that these proteins are expressed on the plasma membrane as well as on intracellular organelles and each function or are proposed to function to increase the cytosolic concentration of zinc. While the subcellular localization of most of the ZIP family of proteins has been elucidated, the mechanistic details of these proteins including the driving force of cation translocation, residues essential for transport and the molecular determinants which define the differing cation selectivity between the ZIP family of proteins have not been well resolved. The objective of this review is to describe the current understanding of cation transport, mediated by the mammalian family of ZIP proteins and to present some molecular determinants that may contribute to the differing substrate specificity for this family of proteins.",

The energy for transport of small peptides and peptide-like drugs is provided by the proton gradient across the cell membrane.

Accumulating evidence points to the involvement of copper in lipid metabolism, antimicrobial defense, neuronal activity, resistance of tumor cells to platinum-based chemotherapeutic drugs, kinase-mediated signal transduction, and other essential cellular processes. For many of these processes, the precise mechanism of copper action remains to be established.

Their prokaryotic relatives are often involved in essential physiological processes in microorganisms, e.g. in homeostasis and acidic/osmotic stress response. High-resolution X-ray structures of the sequence-unrelated amino acid transporters unraveled a striking structural similarity between carriers, which were formerly assigned to different families. The highly conserved fold is characterized by two inverted structural repeats of five transmembrane helices each and indicates common mechanistic transport concepts if not an evolutionary link among a large number of amino acid transporters. Therefore, these transporters are classified now into the structural amino acidpolyamineorganocation superfamily (APCS). The APCS includes among others the mammalian SLC6 transporters and the heterodimeric SLC7/SLC3 transporters. However, it has to be noted that the APCS is not limited entirely to amino acid transporters but contains also transporters for, e.g. amino acid derivatives and sugars. For instance, the betainecholinecarnitine transporter family of bacterial activity-regulated Na+- and H+-coupled symporters for glycine betaine and choline is also part of this second largest structural superfamily. The APCS fold provides different possibilities to transport the same amino acid. Arginine can be transported by an H+-coupled symport or by antiport mechanism in exchange against agmatine for example. The convergence of the mechanistic concept of transport under comparable physiological conditions allows speculating if structurally unexplored amino acid transporters, e.g. the members of the SLC36 and SLC38 family, belong to the APCS, too. In the kidney, which is an organ that depends critically on the regulated amino acid transport, these different SLC transporters have to work together to account for proper function. Here, we will summarize the basic concepts of Na+- and H+-coupled amino acid symport and amino acidproduct antiport in the light of the respective physiological requirements.",

Based on the sequence data and biochemical and biophysical analyses, the role of extramembranous loops in sugar and inhibitor binding can be delineated.

The same basic model is proposed for GLUT1. Studies on GLUT1 have pioneered the isolation of eukaryotic transporters by biochemical methods and the development of transport kinetics and transporter models. For GLUT1, results from extensive mutagenesis, cysteine substitution and accessibility studies can be incorporated into a homology model with a barrel-like structure in which accessibility to the extracellular and intracellular medium is altered by pinching movements of some of the helices.

MCT1 through MCT4 (MCTs 14) are H+-coupled monocarboxylate transporters, MCT8 and MCT10 transport thyroid hormone and aromatic amino acids, while the substrate specificity and function of other MCTs have yet to be determined. The focus of this review is on MCTs 14 because their role in lactate transport is intrinsically linked to cellular metabolism in various biological systems, including skeletal muscle, brain, retina, and testis. Although MCTs 14 all transport lactate, they differ in their transport kinetics and vary in tissue and subcellular distribution, where they facilitate lactate-shuttling between glycolytic and oxidative cells within tissues and across bloodtissue barriers. However, the role of MCTs 14 is not confined to cellular metabolism. By interacting with bicarbonate transport proteins and carbonic anhydrases, MCTs participate in the regulation of pH homeostasis and fluid transport in renal proximal tubule and corneal endothelium, respectively. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of MCTs 14, linking their cellular distribution to their functions in various parts of the human body, so that we can better understand the physiological roles of MCTs at the systemic level.",

Each lobe (N- and C-lobe) of hTF forms a deep cleft which binds a single Fe3+. Iron-bearing hTF in the blood binds tightly to the specific transferrin receptor (TFR), a homodimeric transmembrane protein. After undergoing endocytosis, acidification of the endosome initiates the release of Fe3+ from hTF in a TFR-mediated process. Iron-free hTF remains tightly bound to the TFR at acidic pH; following recycling back to the cell surface, it is released to sequester more iron. Efficient delivery of iron is critically dependent on hTF/TFR interactions. Therefore, identification of the pH-specific contacts between hTF and the TFR is crucial. Recombinant protein production has enabled deconvolution of this complex system. The studies reviewed herein support a model in which pH-induced interrelated events control receptor-stimulated iron release from each lobe of hTF.",

Despite the variety in techniques, some generic fusion pathways emerge that predict a more complex picture beyond the traditional stalkpore pathway. Indeed the traditional pathway is confirmed in particle-based simulations, but in addition alternative pathways are observed in which stalks expand linearly rather than radially, leading to inverted-micellar or asymmetric hemifusion intermediates. Simulations also suggest that the first barrier to fusion is not the formation of the stalk, but rather, the formation of a lipid bridge consisting of one or two lipids only. Fusion occurring during the fission process involves other intermediates, however, and is not just fusion reversed.

The chapter evaluates hypotheses that TJs are the gatekeepers of an immune-privileged myelin compartment and that TJs emerged during evolution to form major adhesive forces within the myelin sheath. The chapter discusses the implications of disrupted CNS myelin TJs in the contexts of behavioral disorders and demyelinating or hypomyelinating diseases and explores the evidence of possible mechanism governing affective disorder symptoms in patients with white matter abnormalities.",

By combining the tools of molecular biology, electrophysiology, immunocytochemistry, and fracture labeling, new information has been generated regarding the structure/function relationships of selected claudins in the TJ. A variety of morphological techniques have been applied to the study of TJ structure and function. These include immunofluorescence microscopy for the localization of integral tight junction proteins in the plasma membrane and cytoplasmic proteins that bind specifically to the N- or C-termini of claudins, occludin, and tricellulin. The ion selectivity of the tight junction pores appears to be governed by the amino acid composition of the specific claudins that form these pores. With the application of novel biochemical reagents, the structure of these tight junction pores within the tight junction is beginning to be characterized. To date, relatively few of the 24 known claudins have been analyzed for their pore-forming function and detailed tissue distribution. However, recently discovered mutations in a number of claudin genes that are associated with human disease, have yielded valuable new insight regarding the function of several specific claudins.",

OMPs have a variety of different functions, but, at their core, they allow compounds in and out the cell. OMPs are relatively easy to produce and crystallize, and this has resulted in the publication of many studies. The defining characteristic of these proteins is the -barrel transmembrane region. It has been assumed that all OMPs are -barrels. The publication of the first -helical OMPs, Wza shows this is not the case. The structural determination of eukaryotic integral and bacterial inner membrane proteins has been more challenging. In most cases, the production of stable protein has been the principal difficulty. Several research groups have developed new technologies to overcome these challenges. This chapter highlights some of the most recent ones.

This was partially because of the fact that these proteins are responsible for the production of all oxygen in the atmosphere. Photosynthetic organisms are the primary producers of nearly all the biomass and bioenergy produced on the earth. From a practical point of view, they are abundant in their source organisms, and their pigment content facilitates tracking them in their native form in experiments.

Bicelles are a mixture of a detergent and a lipid and can be described as a compromise between the two media with beneficial aspects from both. Membrane proteins reconstituted in bicelles are maintained in a native like bilayer environment and can be manipulated with almost the same ease as detergent solublized membrane proteins, making it compatible with standard high-throughput screening.

In addition, SIC allows the selection of specific solution conditions (including detergent type and concentration) for subsequent optimization of protein solubility, homogeneity, and crystallization. Balanced solubility and crystallization screens have been designed, such that B values are experimentally measured via SIC for a relatively small number of conditions, providing a balanced representation of the total number of possible combinations of chemical variables. The screen conditions plus corresponding B values are then used to train a predictive algorithm (neural net) that subsequently produces an in silico screen, predicting the B values for all possible combinations of the chemical variables. The high-positive B values indicate solution conditions that should provide increased protein solubility and consequently, minimization of nonspecific protein aggregation. Slightly negative B values indicate solution conditions that have a higher probability of yielding crystals. The combined use of these innovative technologies provides a powerful approach to address several of the critical impediments (i.e., protein production, stability, purification, and crystallization) preventing membrane structure determinations.",

A series of vectors utilizing promoters responding to oxygen and/or light has been constructed. A variety of engineered host strains is available that carry deletions of one or more native transmembrane complexes, thereby increasing the membrane volume available for the accommodation of foreign protein. Using this approach, data suggest that many target membrane proteins from a variety of organisms can be produced and purified at levels that equal or exceed those of native membrane protein complexes (10 mg/l). Standardized strategies have been developed for semiautomation of cloning and purification. An analysis of nearly 500 expression strains (including representatives encompassing an entire membrane proteome) has shown that 60% of the membrane proteins are expressed in Rhodobacter at levels that exceed 1 mg/l of cell culture (many at levels of 1020 mg/l) are localized within intracytoplasmic membranes (ICMs), andmost importantlydisplay structural and functional integrity.

The primary mechanism for gas conduction across the cellular membrane is deemed to be free diffusion of the species across lipid bilayers, however, the involvement of a number of membrane channels in the process has also been suggested. In this chapter we summarize the results of recent molecular dynamics simulations investigating the mechanism and pathways through which O 2, CO 2, and other biologically relevant gas species are exchanged between the two sides of the membrane. Different computational methodologies are employed, including explicit gas diffusion simulations where multiple copies of the gas species of interest are explicitly included in the simulation, under either equilibrium or biased chemical potential conditions, and implicit ligand sampling where the distribution of small, neutral ligands (gas molecules) inside membrane and/or a protein are deduced from the simulation of the ligand-free system. The results of simulations of pure lipid bilayers indicate that although the lipid bilayers are permeable by the gas species investigated, there is a significant barrier against gas permeation in the head-group layer. The barrier appears to be, at least partly, due to a tighter structure of water in the head-group region and can be markedly affected by changes in the head-group composition of the bilayer. In addition to lipid bilayers, several membrane channels were also investigated. Interestingly, almost all studied systems provide one or more pathways for gas conduction. Some of the identified gas conduction pathways are along the symmetry axis of oligomeric membrane channels, which might suggest the first functional implication for oligomerization of these proteins inside the membrane.",

To facilitate the faithful transmission of light rays from the corneal surface to the retinal photoreceptors, the eye is pressurized, having three compartments that are filled with optically transparent fluids: vitreous humor occupies 80% of the interior volume of the eye and lies between the posterior face of the lens and the retina; aqueous humor fills the other two compartments, the anterior and posterior chambers, located on either side of the iris. The circulation of aqueous humor from the posterior to the anterior chamber (and then out of the eye) enables the delivery of nutrients and removal of waste products from two specialized avascular tissues, the cornea and crystalline lens that function to focus light onto the retina. The clarity of these two organic lenses, and thus their ability to refract light, is exquisitely dependent upon water homeostasis within and the circulation of aqueous humor around their structures. This chapter reviews data that characterize the role of aquaporins in the movement of water into and out of the eye (aqueous humor dynamics). First, it provides an overview of aquaporin discovery and its molecular structure and function in cellular membranes. Second, it summarizes the specific distribution of aquaporin homologues in the eye. Third, it discusses the specific role of aquaporin channels in aqueous humor dynamics. Finally, the chapter discusses the future direction of aquaporin research in aqueous humor dynamics and the potential of aquaporins as drug targets.",

Sodium ions enter the apical membranes of both type I and type II alveolar epithelial cells through sodium selective, cation and cyclic nucleotide gated ion channels and are extruded across the basolateral membrane by the ouabain-sensitive Na,K-ATPase. This vectorial transport of Na + ions (and concomitant movement of Cl  ions to maintain electroneutrality) creates an oncotic force leading to the reabsorption of fluid across both normal and damaged lungs. Nitric oxide and reactive oxygen nitrogen intermediates (formed by the reactions of nitric oxide with partially reduced oxygen species), generated in close proximity of epithelial cell membranes by activated inflammatory cells, modulate the activity of sodium channels via signal transduction mechanisms (such as increasing PKG and PKC) or by post-translational oxidative modifications of sodium channel proteins and their chaperons. Channel activity (and vectorial sodium transport) may be either increased or decreased depending on levels of reactive intermediates and length of exposure.

The role of extracellular purines places a novel spin on the theory of neurochemical imbalance, with extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) released through pressure-sensitive pathways either stimulating lethal P2X7 receptors on ganglion cells, or being converted to adenosine and protecting them.

The edema clearance is carried out mostly by the coordination of the apical Na + channels and the basolateral Na,K-ATPase effecting active Na + transport. Downregulation of Na + transport occurs frequently in ARDS patients and results in impaired edema clearance. Hypoxia, hyperoxia, particulate matter and thrombin inhibit edema clearance. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from the electron transport chain in the mitochondria and/or NADPH oxidase appears to be critical for the impaired edema clearance under these stress conditions. During hypoxia, ROS activate PKC , which in turn phosphorylates Na,K-ATPase  1 subunit at Ser-18, leading to the endocytosis of Na,K-ATPase from the plasma membrane. The endocytosis of Na,K-ATPase results in decreased Na,K-ATPase activity and can be prevented by antioxidants. We propose that ROS act as signaling molecules regulating the activity of Na,K-ATPase, which is important for alveolar fluid reabsorption. Further studies into the mechanisms by which Na,K-ATPase is regulated will be of importance for development of novel strategies for the treatment of edema patients.",

We survey theoretical, experimental and simulation approaches and report free energy simulations that reveal large barriers for charged side chain movement across membranes. In simulations of an arginine side chain attached to a transmembrane -helix and its simple side chain analog molecule, significant penetration of water and lipid head groups into the membrane core is seen. Yet there exists differences in the shape and magnitude of the free energy profiles due to the presence of the host helix. Calculated p K a shifts within the membrane suggest that arginine will remain mostly protonated throughout the membrane if attached to a transmembrane helix. The discrepancy between simulation and a recent translocon-based assay is explained in terms of several factors, including the difficulties in obtaining a spatial interpretation from these experiments.

Endothelial monolayer permeability increases as a result of both disruption of endothelial cellcell contacts and EC contraction. Disruption of endothelial cellcell junctions occurs concomitantly with the redistribution and tyrosine phosphorylation of the VE-cadherin-containing adherens junction (AJ) protein complexes. Little is known about mechanisms of how endothelial permeability is regulated. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) including superoxide ( O 2  ) and hydrogen peroxide (H 2O 2) generated by activated polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMNs) and endothelial cells (ECs) impair endothelial barrier integrity by promoting loss of cellcell adhesions and reorganization of actin cytoskeleton. These responses are involved in promoting transendothelial migration of PMNs and endothelial permeability. Major source of ROS in PMNs and ECs is NADPH oxidase. Phagocyte NADPH oxidase consists of membrane-bound gp91phox and p22hox as well as cytosolic components such as p47phox, p67phox and small GTPase Rac. Recently, several novel homologues of gp91phox (Nox2) of NADPH oxidase (Nox) have been cloned in non-phagocytic cells. In ECs Nox1, Nox2, Nox4 and Nox5 are functionally expressed. NADPH oxidase in ECs is activated by inflammatory cytokines, thrombogenic agents, growth factors, G-protein coupled receptor agonists and shear stress. ROS derived from NADPH oxidase function as signaling molecules to activate various redox signaling pathways through modulating activity of kinases and phosphatases, which may contribute to increase in endothelial permeability. Understanding mechanisms by which ROS regulate endothelial permeability is important for the development of novel therapeutic approaches against various diseases such as inflammation, atherogenesis and acute lung injury.",

The disease affects a large number of people, especially those among the older population. The causes leading to the development of glaucoma can be the result of the dysfunction of several tissues. The major risk for glaucoma is elevated intraocular pressure that is the consequence of an improper regulation of aqueous humor outflow in the anterior segment of the eye (ciliary body and trabecular meshwork). Elevated pressure in turn, affects the posterior segment by exerting mechanical strain on the optic nerve and provoking deformation, distortion of axonal flow, and death of the nerve cells (lamina cribrosa and retinal ganglion cells). The function of any given tissue is governed by the regulation of expression of its genes. Functional genomics offers an invaluable tool to identify the molecular differences affecting the cells under conditions associated with glaucoma. This chapter discusses such changes.

These are the degenerin/epithelial Na+ channels (Deg/ENaCs) and transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. Some of these channels open in response to mechanical forces and/or mediate cellular responses to mechanical stimulation. TRPA1 is expressed in nociceptive neurons of peripheral ganglia and in the sensory epithelia of the inner ear. In nociceptors, TRPA1 forms chemosensitive channels that mediate the response to exogenous painproducing chemicals as well as to the endogenous proalgesic bradykinin (BK). More indirect evidence suggests that TRPA1 might also form mechanosensory channels. Some of the TRP channels that mediate mechanical responses are not necessarily mechanically gated. For example, TRPV4 mutant mice have reduced sensitivity to noxious tactile stimulation, and heterologously expressed TRPV4 opens in response to hypotonic solution (which induces cell swelling and thus stretches membranes). TRPA1 genes in mammals are large, occupy around 50 kb of chromosomal DNA and are encoded by at least 27 exons. In humans, the TRPA1 gene is located on chromosome 8q13.",

Phospholipids, including PIP2, exert a dual dose-dependent effect on TREK1. Low concentrations transform the mechanogated K+ channel TREK1 into a leak K+ channel. The phospholipidsensing domain is a positively charged cluster in the proximal Cterminal domain. This region also encompasses the proton sensor E306 that is required for the activation of TREK1 by cytosolic acidosis. Protonation of E306 increases channelphospholipid interaction leading to TREK1 opening without direct-mechanical stimulation. At higher concentrations, intracellular phospholipids inhibit channel activation by stretch, intracellular acidosis, and AA. Binding endogenous negative inner leaflet phospholipids with polylysine reduces the inhibition and reveals channel stimulation by exogenous intracellular phospholipids. Both stimulatory and inhibitory effects are observed with phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylserine (PS), and phosphatidic acid (PA), but not diacylglycerol (DG), suggesting that the phosphate at position 3 is required, although the net charge is not critical.

Systematic genetic analysis has facilitated the dissection of the molecular mechanisms that underlie mechanosensation in the nematode. Studies of various worm mechanosensitive behaviors have converged to identify highly specialized plasma membrane ion channels that are required for the conversion of mechanical energy to cellular signals. Strikingly, similar mechanosensitive ion channels appear to function at the core of the mechanotransduction apparatus in higher organisms, including humans.

The response to stretch of a particular muscle or organ is tuned to specific functional needs by the types of ion channels expressed. Mechanosensitive ionic conductances that yield either inward or outward currents have been observed in and characterized in studies of smooth muscles. In vascular muscles, the dominant response to stretch is muscle contraction (the myogenic response). This chapter proposes several mechanisms for the myogenic response; one of these hypotheses involves stretchdependent activation of nonselective cation channels. The inward current resulting from an activation of these channels causes plasma membrane depolarization, activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, Ca2+ entry, and excitationcontraction coupling. Thus, increasing the vascular pressure and distension of blood vessels cause responsive vasoconstriction. Other conductances are also proposed as participants in the myogenic response, and progress characterizing the inward current channels responsive to stretch is summarized. Outward currents responding to muscle stretch are also present in smooth muscles. For example, expression of stretchsensitive twopore domain K+ (K2P) channels has been reported in visceral smooth muscles. These organs resist contraction on filling and provide a reservoir function. Stretch-dependent outward current channels are hypothesized to help stabilize membrane potential until it becomes desirable to empty the stored contents.

The nociceptive membrane at the sensory nerve terminals, however, cannot be so well analyzed. These plasma membrane transducer proteins synthesized in the cell body are trafficking to the peripheral nerve terminals. But it should be kept in mind that the same ion channel is present in the soma and in the nerve terminal; their operation and distribution in intracellular membrane structures at the nerve ending may differ from those analyzed in the cell body in vitro. Therefore, data obtained by single unit recordings from peripheral nerves are reviewed in the chapter. It also describes the function of cation channels in the plasma membrane of the nociceptors.",

These collective studies from pharmacological and genetic approaches reveal that selective modulations of different VDCCs may provide novel therapeutic modalities for the treatment of various types of pain. VDCCs play a pivotal role in sensory processing, including nociception, by increasing the intracellular Ca2+ concentration of neurons in response to excitation. Painrelated behaviors in several VDCC knockout mice have been studied to yield significant progress in elucidating the physiological importance of various subtypes of VDCCs in pain transmission at the level of the organism. Sensory stimuli are relayed from the periphery to the cortex as a form of action potential by a series of the excitation of relay neurons. VDCCs are also involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release, membrane excitability, electrical spiking behavior, and gene expression.",

VGSCs are the key element of excitable cells in the generation and transmission of electrical activity. VGSCs play a fundamentally important role in the excitability of almost all neurons in the central and peripheral nervous systems. They are located in the plasma membrane and mediate the influx of sodium ions into the cell in response to membrane depolarization. Sodium influx results in the generation of the action potential. Ten distinct poreforming subunits of VGSCs are identified in vertebrates and many of these are localized in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Peripheral nerve injury result in neuropathic pain in which normally painful peripheral stimuli produce severe pain and normally nonpainful stimuli produce pain. Dynamic changes in VGSCs after nerve injury play an important role in generating ectopic discharges and spontaneous activity of sensory neurons.",

This channel is one component of a much larger repertoire of transduction mechanisms available to nociceptors. The prominent expression of TRPV1 in unmyelinated smalldiameter neurons and its activation by noxious chemical and physical stimuli make this channel a compelling candidate transducer of painful stimuli in vivo. Among the array of stimuli that can excite nociceptors, capsaicin, protons, and noxious heat have attracted considerable attention because of their robust actions on these cells. TRPV1 is essential for nociceptive responses to capsaicin; there is evidence for a substantial contribution from TRPV1independent processes to acute heat nociception.

It was during this period when the background was formed for channels, receptors, and transmitters. Prior to the 17th century, sensations and emotions were mostly thought to arise in the heart and in the brain ventricles. The nerves conducting sensations were shown as tubes containing a fluid as the messenger system. Inside the brain these tubes had pores or valves that could open and close to control the activity of the brain. In response to the sensory input, the same mechanism of opening and closing valves activates the motor nerves inducing movements to escape the noxious stimulus. The valves or pores conceived by Descartes were the universal elements to initiate sensory and motor messages, and thus may be considered as the visionary forerunners of modern channel concepts.",

In addition, their expression patterns are consistent with major roles as thermosensors. Some of these TRP channels are clearly sensitive to nonthermal stimuli and can act as polymodal receptors in sensory nerve cells and in other tissues. Following the identification of TRPV1, other TRP channels are found to encode sensitivity to hot, warm, cool, and cold temperatures. As TRPV1, TRPV2 is also activated by high temperatures over 52C. TRPV3 shows a high degree of homology to TRPV1 and is activated by warm temperatures with a threshold of 33C. TRPV3 is expressed in sensory neurons and keratinocytes located in close proximity to free nerve endings, indicating that the signaling of warm stimuli may involve both direct and indirect activation of sensory nerves.",

Chemokines are lowmolecularweight proteins, typically basic, that show to activate and mediate the migration of leukocytes. The chemokine family consists of over 40 members, which are divided into two major and two minor families based on the location of Nterminal cysteine residues. The largest of these families is that of the CC chemokines, which together with their receptors are implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, a variety of autoimmune disorders, and viral infections. Chemokines may be produced either constitutively or in response to inflammatory stimuli. Constitutively produced chemokines have important homeostatic roles in lymphocyte trafficking to and from a variety of organs; for example, CCL19 coordinates the emergence of newly generated Tcells from the thymus to the general circulation. The biological effects of chemokines are mediated by their binding to cell surface receptors that belong to Class I of the rhodopsinlike Gproteincoupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, which is believed to number over 900 members in the human genome.",

During epithelial morphogenesis, it emerges early and remains detectable in epithelial sheets in some developing epithelial basement membranes throughout embryogenesis. Laminin 1 acts as an efficient attachment protein for a large variety of cells in culture. This attachment promotes the survival of cells, increased proliferation, and the induction and maintenance of the differentiated state. Type IV collagen constitutes one of the major components of basement membranes. It is noted that a collagenase activity that specifically degrade type IV collagen is increased fourfold when hormones are omitted from the cultures. Perlecan, a heparan sulfate proteoglycan, and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan are the main proteoglycans associated with basement membranes.

Purinergic signaling is implicated in the regulation of many epithelial cell functions. In addition to triggering cell signaling, mainly through cytosolic calcium and phospholipase-coupled signal transduction and possibly through other cellular mechanisms, extracellular nucleotide signaling also modulates the potency of other autacoids and hormones that regulate epithelial cell function. Extracellular nucleotides and nucleosides also regulate transepithelial ion transport. The extracellular nucleotides and nucleosides, through P2Y, P2X, and P1 receptors, stimulate secretory Cl  and H 2 O transport, activate K + channels, inhibit absorptive Na + transport, modulate acidbase transport, and potentiate regulatory volume decrease, following hypotonic cell swelling. Purinergic receptor-driven functions include the triggering of calcium sparks and waves, potentiating ciliary beat frequency, and promoting mucus, glandular, and acinar secretion. Constitutive adenosine triphosphate (ATP) release and signaling are implicated in the maintenance of cell signaling setpoints for cytosolic calcium, phosphoinositide turnover, and arachidonic acid metabolism.

These physiological sources are cells that synthesize ATP as their chief intracellular fuel. A list of cell types implicated or studied for their ATP release capacity is provided in the chapter. The bacterial adherence, anoxia, ischemia, apoptosis, and necrosis can lead to partial or complete cell lysis and subsequent ATP release. There are multiple physiological stimuli that activate physiological mechanisms, which potentiate ATP release from cells. The aforementioned lytic stimuli are pathophysiological triggers. There is an enormous chemical concentration gradient for ATP release from cells. Because no assay has measured a steady state extracellular concentration above 10 M under stimulated conditions (likely because of degradative enzymes competitively clearing a portion of the released ATP) a mammalian cell releases only 0.1% of its total intracellular ATP pool. Adenosine receptors have 50% effective concentration EC 50 values that are equal to or less than 1  M.

This current is strongly outwardly rectifying and has a reversal potential close to the Cl  equilibrium potential. Current kinetics at positive potentials is characterized by a slowly activating component and a rapid deactivation at negative potentials. Activation is faster at more positive membrane potentials and higher intracellular Ca 2+ concentrations ([Ca 2+ ] i ). Deactivation is Ca 2+ independent and faster at more negative potentials. Outward tail currents are slowly decaying, whereas inward tail currents decay much faster. Steady-state currents show strong outward rectification, but the instantaneous current-voltage relationship is nearly ohmic. The halide permeability sequence of the Ca 2+ -activated conductance is Eisenmann I with P I > P Cl > P F > P gluconate . The single channel conductance is approximately 7 pS at 300 m M extracellular Cl  and less than 3 pS at 140 m M Cl  The open probability of the channel is high at positive potentials, but very small at negative potentials. DIDS and niflumic acid inhibit I Cl(Ca) in a voltage-dependent manner, i.e., they exert a more potent block at positive potentials. The block by NPA, NPPB, and tamoxifen is voltage independent. Niflumic acid and tamoxifen are the most potent blockers. The calmodulin antagonists trifluoperazine (TIP) and calmidazolium inhibit I Cl(Ca) . The current is inhibited by intracellularly applied Ins(1,4,5,6)P 4 and Ins(3,4,5,6)P 4 with a concentration for half-maximal inhibition of approximately 10  M . Inhibition by tetrakisphosphates occurred without significant changes in kinetic properties. Gating can be described by a two-step binding of Ca 2+ on a high-affinity site inside the channel. [Ca 2+ ] i for half-maximal activation of I Cl(Ca) is voltage dependent, and suggests that the apparent binding constant for Ca 2+ decreases with depolarization. Its value at 0 mV is 430 n M , and the putative binding site is 12% within the electrical field from the cytoplasmic side. The Hill coefficient, n H , of binding is larger than 1 and increases with depolarization. The maximal Cl  conductance at saturating [Ca 2+ ] i does not depend on membrane potential. Ca 2+ -activated Cl  currents coexist in vascular endothelial cells with at least two other Cl  channels, i.e., the volume-regulated anion channels VRAC and CFIR. Their molecular identity as well as their functional role are still uncertain. Likely, coactivation with agonist-induced Ca 2+ release and Ca 2+ entry points to a possible role in regulation of Ca 2+ homeostasis in endothelial cells.

In normal ventricular or atrial cells I Cl(Ca) and I TO1 provide re[olarizing current during action potential phases 1 and 2. The balance of currents early in the action potential, including late I Na , I TO1 , and I Cl(Ca) , are critical to initiation of arrhythmias associated with Brugada syndrome. Evidence from studies in the canine arterially perfused right ventricular wedge indicates that the prominent action potential notch found in epicardial cells permits plateau depression and dramatic shortening of action potentials in regions of the epicardium. This all-or-none repolarization initiates large differences in repolarization across the ventricular wall, setting the stage for various arrhythmias ( Antzelevitch et al. , 1999 ; Tada et al. , 2000 ; Yan and Antzelevitch, 1999 ). The amplitude and duration of I Cl(Ca) normally mirrors rate- and rhythm-dependent changes in the calcium transient. Injuries that alter normal excitation-contraction conpling will likely modify the amplitude of I Cl(Ca) and the balance of currents during early repolarization. Ischemia reduces both peak calcium transients and I Cl(Ca) in cells isolated from 5-day infarcted canine ventricle, and this reduction is most dramatic at fast pacing rates ( Aggarwal et al. , 1997 ). The amplitude of calcium transients is also reduced in a dog model of chronic rapid atrial pacing, and it would be interesting to discover how changes in I Cl(Ca) might alter action potential duration in this rapid pacing model ( Sun et al. , 1998 ). In dog and sheep ventricles, I Cl(Ca) and I NaCa produce an oscillating inward current at diastolic voltages in calcium overloaded cells. These contraction-related currents initiate DADs and ectopic beats. Evidence from animal and human studies indicates reentry is the primary mechanism underlying arrhythmogenesis, but that focal mechanisms might initiate ventricular arrhythmias under certain pathophysiological conditions. Three-dimensional cardiac mapping performed in dogs with ischemic cardiomyopathy induced by intracoronary embolizations reveals that monomorphic ventricular tachycardia is due to focal activation of subendocardial sites ( Pogwizd, 1994 ). Similarly, d -sotalol-induced polymorphic tachyarrhythmias with characteristics of torsade de pointes are initiated by spontaneous premature beats originating in the subendocardium ( Shimizu and Antzelevitch, 1997 ). Such focal activation might arise as DADs originating in ventricular cells or Purkinje fibers. An important next step to understand the role of I Cl(Ca) during reperfusion- and drug-induced arrhythmias will be to determine whether I NaCa and I Cl(Ca) are affected differently by intracellular pH, calcium loading of the SR, and the metabolic components of ischemia.",

The combination of circular dichroism, microelectrophoresis, and fluorescence quenching data showed that this peptide converted from a random coil in the aqueous phase to a hammock configuration in bilayers, with both termini exposed to the aqueous phase on the outside of the lipid vesicle and a central hydrophobic a -helical segment located near the hydrocarbon-water interface. Although the free energy of binding G depended on the charge of the lipid, indicating the importance of electrostatics, the peptide bound to zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine (PC) bilayers with G = 6.3 kcal/mol. Analysis of isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) data indicated that both conformational changes in the peptide and the hydrophobic effect contributed to this binding to PC bilayers. Peptide binding and -helix formation were essentially eliminated by adding lipids containing large, oriented dipoles located a few angstroms into the bilayer hydrocarbon region, pointing to an important role for interfacial dipoles. That is, for PC bilayers containing either 6-ketocholestanol or PCs with nitroxide moieties at the 7-position in one of their acyl chains, G was reduced to 3 kcal/mol. Binding experiments with polyunsaturated PCs showed that G was not strongly dependent on molecular area. However, incorporation of cholesterol into the PC bilayer, which increases the area expansion or isothermal compressibility modulus, modified the energetics of binding. Increasing concentrations of cholesterol reduced G to about 5 kcal/mol at equimolar cholesterol, but even more markedly reduced the enthalpy H of binding from 8 kcal/mol in the absence of cholesterol to near 0 kcal/mol with equimolar cholesterol. Thus, peptide binding was enthalpically driven for PC bilayers, but entropically driven for equimolar PC: cholesterol bilayers. We conclude that variations in lipid composition that alter bilayer properties, including fixed charges, interfacial dipoles, and isothermal compressibility modulus, can strongly influence peptide binding.",

Many viral fusion proteins and proteins probably responsible for intracellular fusion fold into a bundle of coiled-coils. Formation of these coiled-coils is thought to be responsible for bringing membranes close together and may also cause the fusion event. Based on studies using the hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza virus, a prototypic fusion protein, the most likely sequence for fusion is as follows: Membranes make local contact by bending toward each other; the contacting lipid monolayers merge at these sites, yielding a state of hemifusion; with the subsequent merger of distal leaflets, fusion is completed. Many properties of lipids contribute to the fusion process. Important among these is spontaneous monolayer curvature. The contribution of spontaneous curvature to fusion is the best-understood aspect of the process in quantitative biophysical terms. Positive spontaneous curvature of contacting leaflets inhibits hemifusion, negative spontaneous curvature promotes it. Intermediate states that exhibit properties of hemifusion and can proceed on to full fusion have been captured and characterized. The transmembrane domain of HA greatly augments the transition from hemifusion to full fusion, but is not essential. The amino acid sequence of this domain is not critical, indicating that the conversion of hemifused to fused membranes occurs by a physical process. The growth of fusion pores is regulated by fusion proteins and affected by the lipid composition of the fused membranes.",

It utilizes some membrane transporters in common with the cyclic-nucleotide-mediated mechanisms, but may also depend on the activity of independent transporters, such as apical calcium-activated chloride channels (CLCA) of the CLCA family. Calcium-mediated chloride secretion is also the subject of complex and integrated regulatory mechanisms that may be both positive and negative. The negative signaling mechanisms, which may be activated by calcium-dependent secretagogues themselves or by exogenous factors, such as peptide growth factors, likely account for the transient nature of the calcium-dependent secretory response by serving as a physiological brake on the process.

Lu-ECAM-1 was identified during a comprehensive search for molecular principles involved in organ preference of metastasis.

This current is conducted by two types of channel: a cyclic-nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel that conducts cations and a Ca 2+ -activated Cl  channel. Odorants are detected at the surface of the olfactory epithelium, which lines parts of the nasal cavity. The epithelium contains three cell types. The basal progenitor cells may differentiate into supporting (sustentacular) cells or into ORNs. The supporting cells secrete a mucus layer that coats the luminal surface of the epithelium. The receptor neurons are bipolar. Each neuron projects into the mucus a dendrite, which terminates in an olfactory knob or vesicle. From each knob, fine olfactory cilia emanate into the mucus. In the plasma membrane of these cilia, odorous stimuli are transduced into an electrical signal that most often depolarizes the neuron.

A number of strategies have been employed to design effective peptides. Successful strategies include making educated guesses based on protein primary sequence, using binding studies to define sites of protein-protein interaction, and designing peptides based on the three-dimensional structure of known sites of interaction. Once peptides have been synthesized, it is important to characterize their actions in vitro before introducing them into cells. Particularly valuable in this regard are affinity chromatography, to define the binding partners of the peptides, and measurements of the actions of peptides upon binary interactions between presynaptic proteins.

The computational model partitions the membrane interaction free energies into three components: electrostatic attraction between basic groups on the protein and acidic phospholipids in the membrane, desolvation of the protein and membrane as they associate, and nonpolar burial of aromatic side chains into the membrane interface. The electrostatic components of the binding free energy are calculated by solving the Poisson-Boltzmann equation for protein/ membrane systems represented in atomic detail (finite-difference Poisson-Boltzmann [FDPB] method). The nonpolar component is calculated as the product of an interfacial hydrophobicity coefficient and the change in solvent-accessible surface area of aromatic side chains as they penetrate the interface. The model predicts how membrane association changes as a function of the electrostatic properties of the system and how different combinations of electrostatic and nonpolar forces dictate a wide range of membrane-binding properties. The success of the FDPB methodology in describing experimentally characterized biophysical systems establishes the applicability of classical electrostatics and the continuum approach to protein/ membrane systems and justifies its extension to predicting the structural origins of the interfacial association of proteins of known structure.

Xenopus laevis oocytes is one of the most favored systems for the expression of heterologous proteins. Because the CaIC can be found within every oocyte and the CaIC is not down-regulated during maturation as most of the other oocyte transporters and ion channels, it can be argued that CalC is important for further developmental changes that the oocyte is undergoing. In addition, the jelly coat that surrounds the eggs when spawned into hypotonic pondwater keeps the external Ca 2+ concentration at a level at which CaIC activates. It can be hypothesized that CaIC plays a role in the generation of the fertilization potential and the subsequent depolarization of the egg membrane to avoid polyspermy. The CaIC channels could have important binding sites for Ca 2+ , thereby serving as sensors for external Ca 2+ in a way similar to the Ca 2+ -sensing receptor (CSR) that is activated by millimolar changes in extracellular Ca 2+ and that is cloned from the bovine parathyroid.",

Peptide structure is studied by both high-resolution and solid-state NMR methods. Application of high-resolution NMR requires rapid isotropic peptide motions, achieved by conducting experiments in membrane-mimetic environments, that is, organic solvents or detergent solutions. Solid-state NMR investigations are directly conducted on peptides in the membrane-bound state, but experiments often require elimination of peptide motions by freezing or dehydrating samples. Novel NMR techniques utilizing rapid magic angle spinning or oriented peptide/lipid samples have dramatically improved resolution of solid-state NMR experiments in recent years. Peptide binding to lipids changes the membrane hydrophobic thickness and area per molecule, both reflected in lipid order parameter changes. Nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY), in combination with magic angle spinning, is a novel approach to studying structure and dynamics of the lipid matrix.

The most commonly used triggering mechanisms for content release are changes in the environment, such as a change in temperature or pH. In this case, the structure of the liposome membrane changes either by itself or by the presence of environmentally sensitive molecules, which leads to a change of membrane permeability. In this chapter we discuss the interaction of pH-sensitive molecules, such as the influenza fusion peptide mutant AcE4K and the polymer poly(2-ethylacrylic acid), with 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine membranes. We emphasize the ability of these molecules to rearrange the structure of the membrane. This ability is derived from the strength of molecular binding to the membrane interface as well as from the cohesiveness of the membrane itself. The binding of molecules to the membrane has been studied extensively; however, the coupling between binding and membrane cohesiveness is a relatively uncharted area. The binding of pH-sensitive molecules to the membrane is coupled with their protonation, whereas membrane cohesiveness depends on membrane composition. A simple model is introduced where the binding to the membrane and the work for displacing the membrane lipids and creating a vacancy for the binding molecules determine the outcome of the event. The work for creating a vacancy is dependent on membrane cohesiveness, and can be increased by adding cholesterol. The model predicts that the addition of cholesterol will increase the threshold pH for content release. The experimental data fit very well to the predictions of the model. This effect provides an opportunity for designing systems to release drugs in environments of unique pH, such as tumor tissues and endosome interiors.",

The signal peptide performs a targeting function in the cell and serves as a paradigm for the processes by which proteins are targeted to other organelles of the eukaryotic cell, such as the nucleus, the mitochondria, and the peroxisome. Central to signal sequence function is its composite secondary structure, a conserved tripartite motif consisting of a positively charged amino terminus, a central hydrophobic core, and a carboxy-terminal polar domain. Of the three domains, it is the central hydrophobic core, a continuous stretch of 715 hydrophobic amino acids, that is functionally dominant. By virtue of its mean hydrophobicity, the central hydrophobic domain disposes the signal sequence to direct interactions with the lipid bilayer. Nonetheless, the predominant view in the cell biology community is that signal sequences function through direct protein-protein interactions to specify both targeting to the ER and regulation of the protein translocation machinery.

This analysis allows (1) assignment of hydropathy indices to the 20 commonly occurring amino acids and (2) assessment of the membrane insertion potential of a given transmembrane segment as all-or-nothing, depending upon whether its segmental hydrophobicity, calculated from the indices of its component amino acids, surpasses or fails to meet the minimum hydrophobicity requirement for integration into the membrane.

Membrane proteins act as gatekeepers of the cellular environment by allowing passage of ions, small molecules, or nascent proteins under specific environmental signals such as transmembrane voltage, changes in ionic concentration, or binding of a ligand. Molecular dynamics simulations of membrane proteins, performed in a lipid bilayer environment, mimic the cellular environment by representing the solvent, lipids, and the protein in full atomistic detail. These simulations employ periodic boundary conditions in three dimensions to avoid artifacts associated with the finite size of the system. Under these conditions, the membrane protein system is surrounded by ionic solutions on either side of the membrane whose properties cannot be changed independently. We have developed a computational method that allows simulations of membrane proteins under periodic boundary condition while controlling the two ionic solutions properties independently. In this method, an energy barrier is introduced between the two adjacent unit cells and separates the two ionic solutions. The height of the barrier affects the chemical potential of the ions on each side of the barrier, and thus allows for individual control over ionic properties. During the course of the simulation, the height of the barrier is adjusted dynamically to reach the proper ionic concentration on each side. This method has been implemented in the Tcl interface of the molecular dynamics program NAMD. We have applied this method to simulate the voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.2 under physiological conditions, in which the extracellular solution is made of 10mM KCl and 100mM of NaCl solution, while the intracellular solution has an ionic concentration of 100mM KCl and 10mM NaCl. The simulations maintain a 1:10 and 10:1 ratio between ionic concentrations on each side. The simulations are performed under a voltage bias of 100mV and provide the first simulation of potassium channels under the exact physiological condition. The method has also been applied to simulate ionic currents passing through OmpF, an outer membrane porin, under membrane potentials. Here we were able to accurately calculate the reversal potential of the OmpF channel in a tenfold salt gradient of 0.1 intracellular to 1M extracellular KCl. Our results agree with experimental ion conductance measurements and reproduce key features of ion permeation and selectivity of the OmpF channel. Specifically, the I-V plots obtained under asymmetric ionic solutions revealed the natural asymmetry in the channel caused by increased conductance rates observed at positive potentials, as well as the inherent cation-selectivity of the OmpF pore. Therefore, we have developed a method that directly relates molecular dynamics simulations of ionic currents to electrophysiological measurements in ion channels.",

Metastasis is comprised of a series of dynamic processes including cancer cell migration, spreading through circulation system and invasion into distant organs. However, visualization of these underlying steps of metastasis is lack. Although spatiotemporal measurements of cell motion dynamics have been well studied to identify different dynamic patterns, little work has been done to visualize how these dynamic patterns occur on migrating cells. Therefore, we develop spatiotemporal visualization tools to broaden the application of the existing dynamical cell analysis. For instance, we propose visualization techniques to classify the cell edge velocities into three states: protrusion, quiescence and retraction and then visualize when and where these three states of membrane dynamics happen on videos of migrating cells. We also create a semi-automatic tool to allow the users to select the ROIs from the correlation map and then plot the ROIs back onto the original cell migration video. These visualization tools help the biologists to better understand the abstract velocity heat maps in a user friendly way. Biologists can also take the advantage of selecting any ROI through these tools, which enables them to easily observe important migration regions. Furthermore, we investigate the correlation between cell membrane dynamics and subcellular proteins colocalization in a cancer model system and discovered a tight coupling between active membrane dynamics and periodic protein colocalizaiton.

For example a bidder's valuation in fine weather may be different from that in rainy weather. A solution for dealing with this problem is to execute auctions whenever an event occurs and then to re-allocate resources. Re-allocating resources, however, may cause disutility. Moreover, it does not always provide an equilibrium strategy because it can be viewed as a sequential auction, which means that we cannot accurately predict what outcome will be obtained. To solve this problem, we propose an auction protocol that allows bidders to declare the cost due to re-allocation and then decides an allocation based on this cost of re-allocation as well as the surplus obtained from the allocated resources themselves in the realized situation.

Combined with cyclic-monotonicity our results provide a characterization of feasible, Bayesian Incentive Compatible mechanisms in this setting. Our characterization is enabled by a new, constructive proof of Border's theorem [Border 1991], and a new generalization of this theorem to independent (but not necessarily identically distributed) bidders, improving upon the results of [Border 2007, Che-Kim-Mierendorf 2011]. For a single item and independent bidders, we show that every feasible reduced form auction can be implemented as a distribution over hierarchical mechanisms that are consistent with the same strict ordering of all bidders' types, which every mechanism in the support of the distribution irons to a non-strict ordering. We also give a polynomial-time algorithm for determining feasibility of a reduced form auction, or providing a separation hyperplane from the set of feasible reduced forms. To complete the picture, we provide polynomial-time algorithms to find and exactly sample from a distribution over hierarchical mechanisms consistent with a given feasible reduced form. All these results generalize to multi-item reduced form auctions for independent, additive bidders. Finally, for multiple items, additive bidders with hard demand constraints, and arbitrary value correlation across items or bidders, we give a proper generalization of Border's Theorem, and characterize feasible reduced form auctions as multi-commodity flows in related multi-commodity flow instances. We also show that our generalization holds for a broader class of feasibility constraints, including the intersection of any two matroids. As a corollary of our results we compute revenue-optimal, Bayesian Incentive Compatible (BIC) mechanisms in multi-item multi-bidder settings, when each bidder has arbitrarily correlated values over the items and additive valuations over bundles of items, and the bidders are independent. Our mechanisms run in time polynomial in the total number of bidder types (and {not} type profiles). This running time is polynomial in the number of bidders, but potentially exponential in the number of items. We improve the running time to polynomial in both the number of items and the number of bidders by using recent structural results on optimal BIC auctions in item-symmetric settings [Daskalakis-Weinberg 2011].",

We employ these tools to derive price of anarchy results for social welfare and revenue. Our approach separates the standard smoothness framework [e.g., Syrgkanis and Tardos 2013] into two distinct parts. The first part, value covering, employs best-response analysis to individually relate each agent's expected price for allocation and welfare in any Bayes-Nash equilibrium. The second part, revenue covering, uses properties of an auction's rules and feasibility constraints to relate the revenue of the auction to the agents' expected prices for allocation (not necessarily in equilibrium). Because value covering holds for any equilibrium, proving an auction is revenue covered is a sufficient condition for approximating optimal welfare, and under the right conditions, the optimal revenue. In mechanisms with reserve prices, our welfare results show approximation with respect to the optimal mechanism with the same reserves. As a center-piece result, we analyze the single-item first-price auction with individual monopoly reserves (the price that a monopolist would post to sell to that agent alone, these reserves are generally distinct for agents with values drawn from distinct distributions). When each distribution satisfies the regularity condition of Myerson [1981] the auction's revenue is at least a 2eovere-1 \u2248 3.16 approximation to the revenue of the optimal auction revenue.

We examine a common scenario in which only participants that are aware of the information can compete for some reward, and thus informed participants have an incentive not to propagate information to others. One recent example in which such tension arises is the 2009 DARPA Network Challenge (finding red balloons). We focus on another prominent example: Bitcoin, a decentralized electronic currency system. Bitcoin represents a radical new approach to monetary systems. It has been getting a large amount of public attention over the last year, both in policy discussions and in the popular press. Its cryptographic fundamentals have largely held up even as its usage has become increasingly widespread. We find, however, that it exhibits a fundamental problem of a different nature, based on how its incentives are structured. We propose a modification to the protocol that can eliminate this problem. Bitcoin relies on a peer-to-peer network to track transactions that are performed with the currency. For this purpose, every transaction a node learns about should be transmitted to its neighbors in the network. As the protocol is currently defined and implemented, it does not provide an incentive for nodes to broadcast transactions they are aware of. In fact, it provides an incentive not to do so. Our solution is to augment the protocol with a scheme that rewards information propagation. Since clones are easy to create in the Bitcoin system, an important feature of our scheme is Sybil-proofness. We show that our proposed scheme succeeds in setting the correct incentives, that it is Sybil-proof, and that it requires only a small payment overhead, all this is achieved with iterated elimination of dominated strategies. We complement this result by showing that there are no reward schemes in which information propagation and no self-cloning is a dominant strategy.",

We explicitly argue for the first time that, in such domains, approximation can be leveraged to obtain truthfulness without resorting to payments. This stands in contrast to previous work where payments are almost ubiquitous and (more often than not) approximation is a necessary evil that is required to circumvent computational complexity. We present a case study in approximate mechanism design without money. In our basic setting, agents are located on the real line and the mechanism must select the location of a public facility; the cost of an agent is its distance to the facility. We establish tight upper and lower bounds for the approximation ratio given by strategyproof mechanisms without payments, with respect to both deterministic and randomized mechanisms, under two objective functions: the social cost and the maximum cost.

There is, however, a fundamental disconnect between the traditional application domains of mechanism design (such as auctions) and those arising in computer science (such as networks): while monetary \"transfers\" (i.e., payments) are essential for most of the known positive results in mechanism design, they are undesirable or even technologically infeasible in many computer systems. Classical impossibility results imply that the reach of mechanisms without transfers is severely limited. Computer systems typically do have the ability to reduce service quality--routing systems can drop or delay traffic, scheduling protocols can delay the release of jobs, and computational payment schemes can require computational payments from users (e.g., in spam-fighting systems). Service degradation is tantamount to requiring that users \"burn money\", and such \"payments\" can be used to influence the preferences of the agents at a cost of degrading the social surplus. We develop a framework for the design and analysis of \"money-burning mechanisms\" to maximize the residual surplus-the total value of the chosen outcome minus the payments required. Our primary contributions are the following. * We define a general template for prior-free optimal mechanism design that explicitly connects Bayesian optimal mechanism design, the dominant paradigm in economics, with worst-case analysis. In particular, we establish a general and principled way to identify appropriate performance benchmarks in prior-free mechanism design. * For general single-parameter agent settings, we characterize the Bayesian optimal money-burning mechanism. * For multi-unit auctions, we design a near-optimal prior-free money-burning mechanism: for every valuation profile, its expected residual surplus is within a constant factor of our benchmark, the residual surplus of the best Bayesian optimal mechanism for this profile. * For multi-unit auctions, we quantify the benefit of general transfers over money-burning: optimal money-burning mechanisms always obtain a logarithmic fraction of the full social surplus, and this bound is tight.",

In these expressions we note that the cytosolic Ca2+ accumulation is independent of every intracellular calcium flux and depends on the Ca2+ exchange across the membrane, cytosolic calcium diffusion, geometry of the cell, extracellular calcium perturbation, and initial concentrations. In particular, we analyse the time-integrated response of cytosolic calcium due to i) a localised initial concentration of cytosolic calcium and ii) transient extracellular perturbation of calcium. In these scenarios, we conclude that i) the range of calcium progression is confined to the vicinity of the initial concentration, thereby creating calcium microdomains; and ii) we observe a low-pass filtering effect in the response driven by extracellular Ca2+ perturbations.

Understanding whether such a signal can reach from membrane receptors to reporters is essential in studying the cell response to extracellular events. This problem is drastically complicated due to the unreliability of the interaction data. In this paper, we develop a novel method, called PReach (Probabilistic Reachability), that precisely computes the probability that a signal can reach from a given collection of receptors to a given collection of reporters when the underlying signaling network is uncertain. This is a very difficult computational problem with no known polynomial-time solution. PReach represents each uncertain interaction as a bivariate polynomial. It transforms the reachability problem to a polynomial multiplication problem. We introduce novel polynomial collapsing operators that associate polynomial terms with possible paths between sources and targets as well as the cuts that separate sources from targets. These operators significantly shrink the number of polynomial terms and thus the running time. PReach has much better time complexity than the recent solutions for this problem.

Combining both regular unbiased MD and advanced MD methods that bias sampling to important degrees of freedom, new insights are obtained into the function of CD44, which is both a receptor for large carbohydrate molecules in the extracellular matrix and whose own function is modulated by covalent attachment of branched carbohydrates to make CD44 a glycoprotein.

Additionally, the simulations explain, again for the first time, the molecular mechanism through which particular monosaccharides in branched carbohydrates covalently attached to CD44 have been experimentally observed to block CD44 binding to extracellular matrix carbohydrates.

        "des": "One of the important objectives in mass spectrometry-based proteomics is the identification of post-translationally modified sites in cellular and extracellular proteomes. Proteomics techniques have been particularly effective in studying protein phosphorylation, where tens of thousands of new sites have been recently discovered in all domains of life. Such massive discovery of new sites has been facilitated by progress in affinity enrichment techniques, high-throughput analytical platforms that couple liquid chromatography (LC) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), and also powerful computational tools that assign peptides to tandem mass spectra. In this work we focus on computational protocols for identifying phosphoproteins, phosphopeptides, and phosphosites. Although the current tools already provide solid results, most methods have not been tuned to exploit particular sequence and physicochemical properties of phosphopeptides or the peculiarities of their fragment spectra. Therefore, novel algorithms can be designed to increase the sensitivity of phosphosite identification. Here we describe a machine learning-based method that improves the identification of phosphopeptides in LC-MS/MS experiments. Our algorithm is applied as a post-processing step to a standard database search. It assigns a probability score to each peptide-spectrum match (PSM) corresponding to a phosphopeptide, based on the sequence and spectral features of the peptide and its assigned fragment spectra as well as the biological propensity of particular residues in the peptide to be phosphorylated. The algorithm is based on a simple but robust logistic regression model and is used together with a conventional search engine (here, MASCOT) to filter out the PSMs with the lowest probability of being correctly identified. Our protocol was tested on two large phosphoproteomics data sets on which it increased the number of identified phosphopeptides by 10-15% compared to the conventional scoring algorithms at the same false discovery rate threshold of 1%.",

These proteins play many important roles in normal physiology and development, but under pathological conditions, disregulated MMP activity can lead to cancer progression, undesired inflammation, and numerous other conditions [1].\u00a0Biological inhibitors of MMPs in the form of antibodies offer an appealing method for disrupting MMP enzyme activity, as antibodies are capable of potently, specifically inhibiting individual MMPs [2] in ways that traditional small molecules cannot [3]. The key challenge in establishing antibody-based inhibition as a general strategy for interfering with the pathologic functions of MMPs is the lack of fundamental information relating the amino acid sequences of inhibitory antibodies to their unique properties as inhibitors. In this poster, we present a method for analyzing protein sequences to uncover salient features of sequences of antibodies capable of binding to and inhibiting MMPs. The method consists of the following steps. First, we number antibody sequences [4] and divide them into frameworks [6], scaffolds that shape the antibodies' overall structures, and complementarity determining regions (CDRs) [5], peptide loops that directly contact the target MMP or other biological target. Second, we extract frameworks and CDRs [7] from the sequences. Third, we identify the most distinguishing features of antibody utilizing feature selection and machine learning algorithms. We expect to find distinct features of antibodies that bind or inhibit MMPs with this method. Distinct features can be further experimentally evaluated by altering the features unique to MMP-binding or MMP-inhibiting antibodies to assess their importance.",

        "des": "Chlamydophila represents a distinct genus of gram negative bacteria associated with a spectrum of both human and animal disease and, as such, is an important health and economic concern. Central to the pathogenicity of Chlamydophila are antigenic proteins among which the Major Outer Membrane Proteins (MOMP) have received significant attention. MOMP from Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Chlamydia trachomatis, the human pathogens, to date, remain the best characterised. In addition, MOMP-derived peptides have been shown to potentiate anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenecity, by a cell mediated system involving MHC class II proteins [2]. However, despite the importance of this protein as a vaccine target against inflammation driven pathologies attributed to Chlamydia, tremendous challenges in the isolation of this membrane-bound, cysteine-rich protein make it difficult to experimentally isolate the protein for detailed structural and immunological studies. In an effort to reveal a plausible structure and function for Chlamydophila MOMP and aid in the rational design of potential lead candidates for future drug design, computational methods have been employed. Firstly, a knowledge-based approach was used to explore Chlamydia MOMP sequences to identify Asp-ProX (NPX) motifs, commonly found in long chain fatty acid transporters such as aquaporins and some aquaglyceroporins. In Chlamydial MOMPs, a variety of substitutions are found at the third 'X' position; NP-A/S/E/T/K, which may account for its potential to transport a variety of solutes, as a strategy for coping with the absence of essential metabolic enzymes. Earlier findings suggest that MOMP from Chlamydophila pneumoniae is permeable to sugars, amino acids, dicarboxylates and ATP. Subsequent homology modeling of MOMP from C. pneumoniae (using template-based methods) has provided insight into the orientation of these functional motifs in the 3-dimensional structures of MOMPs, from which a plausible novel transport model has been derived [1]. In our model the NPA motif is oriented toward the extracellular side while the two NPS motifs are juxtaposed inside the barrel posed to fulfil a transport role, via solute binding. Secondly, to understand how such MOMP-derived peptides could potentiate an immune response, via binding MHC II alleles, a flexible molecular docking protocol was employed [1]. The reliability of the docking protocol was tested by docking peptides extracted from the PDB coordinates of the MHCs of interest and compared to the original peptide-MHC complex, as seen in the crystal structure of the complex. We used the docking protocol to score four peptides of interest for their candidacy as potential new leads in a rational drug design strategy against chronic inflammation, which characterises Chlamydial involvement in atherosclerosis and respiratory diseases. Our computational work offers new insight into the structure and functional mechanism involved in solute transport via MOMP across Chlamydial cell membranes, which could be used in the design of inhibitors that could obstruct nutrient uptake and halt Chlamydial viability in their host. Also, this work supports the role of MOMP-derived peptides as vaccine candidates for immune-therapy in chronic inflammation that can result in cardiovascular events.",

Basic biological principles must be clearly\r\narticulated to capture their essential features or logic but not\r\nreach beyond legitimate bounds. This paper analyzes the\r\nrelationships among genotype, phenotype, and ontogeny, identifies\r\npitfalls and gaps in these concepts, proposes to abandon the notion\r\nof simple mapping of genotype onto phenotype, and integrates them\r\ninto a more complex, ontologically realistic model of\r\ndevelopment.\nThe gene concept in biology embodies two distinct roles,\r\ninheritance and development: genes carry traits from one generation\r\nto the next and genes encode proteins that specify traits. As\r\nvehicles of inheritance genes are entirely passive. However,\r\nexpression of traits suggests a more active role without specifying\r\nwhat genes do or what they produce.\nResolving this ambiguity must focus on the cellular context in\r\nwhich genes operate during construction of the multicellular body.\r\nThe phenotype (body) is a complex, highly ordered and temporally\r\ndefined state, which requires energy to build and maintain. Genes\r\nprovide templates for proteins necessary for harvesting energy,\r\nmediating exchange between a cell and its surroundings, repair,\r\nreplication, and so forth. According to Harold [1], it is best to\r\nregard a cell \"...as a spatially structured self-organizing system\r\nmade of gene-specified elements\". In other words, genes specify the\r\nelements but not the system in which the elements operate.\nOntogeny (Gk., <i>onto-</i>, existence, being +\r\n-<i>geny</i>, becoming) means literally \"coming into\r\nbeing\", constructing the multicellular body. As development\r\nprogresses, the organism builds itself, and its phenotype\r\n(appearance, traits, organization, function, etc.) changes rapidly.\r\nThe modular body plan enables cell-by-cell control of gene\r\nexpression. Each cell operates in a microenvironment of other\r\ncells, the protein meshwork of the extracellular matrix (ECM), and\r\ntissue fluids. Cell clusters organize into pockets, cavities or\r\nlayers as cells divide, grow, change shape, move about, and pull on\r\nthe fabric of the ECM or adjacent cells to produce an environment\r\nsuitable for subsequent steps of development. Microenvironments and\r\ncontrol of gene expression are the basis for differentiation.\nSome genes encode a single protein (or RNA molecule). Others\r\nencode several proteins (e.g., by alternative splicing),\r\ndemonstrating that 1:1 mapping of genotype to phenotype is too\r\nsimplistic. When extrapolated to a genome-wide perspective,\r\ngenotype is clearly inadequate to specify phenotype, as recent\r\ncloning experiments confirm.\nThe relationship between genotype and phenotype in a developing\r\nembryo is complex, recursive, and linked to the environment (Figure\r\n1). Phenotype is a higher ontological category than genotype\r\nbecause phenotype includes both the structure and function of\r\ncomponents needed to carry out metabolism, communication,\r\nreplication, repair and other higher order (emergent) properties.\r\nNot only is the genotype a representation of a subset of the\r\nphenotypic properties, embryonic functions include control of gene\r\nexpression, which frequently involves signals from other cells,\r\nsignals not genetically encoded but crucial to survival, growth,\r\nand development of the embryo.",

This paper presents a new mechanical-based model for computing in QCA. By avoiding a full quantum-thermodynamical calculation, it offers a classical view of the principles of QCA operation and can be used in evaluating energy dissipation for reversible computing. The proposed model is mechanically based and is applicable to six-dot (neutrally charged) QCA cells for molecular implementation. The mechanical model consists of a sleeve of changing shape; four electrically charged balls are connected by a stick that rotates around an axle in the sleeve. The sleeve acts as a clocking unit, while the angular position of the stick within the changing shape of the sleeve, identifies the phase for quasi-adiabatic switching. A thermodynamic analysis of the proposed model is presented. The behaviors of various QCA basic devices and circuits are analyzed using the proposed model. It is shown that the proposed model is capable of evaluating the energy consumption for reversible computing at device and circuit levels for molecular QCA implementation. As applicable to QCA, two clocking schemes are also analyzed for energy dissipation and performance (in terms of number of clocking zones).",

An algorithm to compute the derivational entropy for RNA secondary structures had previously been introduced, using stochastic context free grammars (SCFGs). However, the numerical value of derivational entropy depends heavily on the chosen context free grammar and on the training set used to estimate rule probabilities. Using data from the Rfam database, we determine that both of our thermodynamic methods, which agree in numerical value, are substantially faster than the SCFG method. Thermodynamic structural entropy values are much smaller than derivational entropy values, and the correlation between length-normalized thermodynamic entropy values and derivational entropy values is moderately weak to poor. Our software RNAentropy can compute structural entropy for any user-specified temperature, and supports both the Turner'99 and Turner'04 energy parameters. Applying our algorithm to the HIV-1 genome indicates that certain genomic regions that harbor important secondary structures have low entropy, when compared to random (dinucleotide shuffled) RNA.

Based on the experimentally determined structures, an effective two-fold potential barrier was imposed on the anomeric linkage. Predictions based on conformational statistics were sensitive to the choice of a three-fold or two-fold torsional barrier at the anomeric linkage.",

Taverna is a graphical workbench often used for biomedical informatics [1, and the references therein]. neoGRID is designed to offer a HPC-supported collaborative environment for the researchers from multidisciplinary scientific fields to gather data, integrate and analyze using teragrid resources. A significant number of resources including bioinformatics tools [2] has been deployed in TeraGrid, an NSF funded project. Besides, the myGrid team produced a suite of tools that are made available for analysis of proteins. In addition, their myExperiment site makes it easy to find, use and share scientific workflows and building scientific communities with common interests. This Cyberinfrastructure (CI)-supported neoGRID can be utilized for protein motifs analysis, particularly in the glycosyltransferase protein family and will be available to the Glyco-Community [3]. Workflows specifically designed for such analysis will be available in neoGRID. Moreover, a significant number of workflows are available in KEGG that are useful for protein analysis and drug discovery research. These and modification of these workflows in a collaborative environment will also be available for drug discovery research using members of glycosyltransferase enzyme family as target protein(s) [4]. Here, we demonstrate the usage of neoGRID for analysis of sialylmotifs of sialyltransferases. The presence of sialylmotifs is the cardinal feature of mammalian sialyltransferases [5], a group of enzymes that transfers sialic acid from CMP-NeuAc to the terminal carbohydrates group of various glycoproteins and glycolipids [6]. Sialic acid has been recognized as the key determinant of a diverse oligosaccharide structures involved in a large variety of biological events as diverse as animal cell-cell interaction to oncogenic transformation [7]. These conserved protein domains, sialylmotifs, have been shown to be involved in binding either the donor or acceptor substrates or both [8, 9], and a disulfide linkage between these two motifs has been shown to be essential for catalytic activity [10, 11]. Protein sequence [12] and structural analysis [11, 13] showed that mammalian sialyltransferase has no similarities with the bacterial enzymes, although a His residue serves as a catalytic center for both [11]. This provides a unique opportunity for discovery research on potential drug development. A thorough analysis of these motifs is now under study for drug discovery research using sialyltransferase as a target protein. Such analysis demanding high-performance computing power is available in neoGRID. The genome of protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii has been used here for bioinformatics analysis. T. gondii, which chronically infects roughly 30% of the world's population is typically asymptomatic but can cause life threatening disease in immune compromised individuals and birth defects of acquired during pregnancy [14]. Sequencing of this parasite genome of about 63 Mb in size with 14 chromosomes, has recently been completed [15, 16]. The availability of this sequence information from multiple isolates in a specially designed database (www.toxodb.org) that also include transcriptomic and proteomic data sets [16], has made this parasite an ideal candidate for in-depth bioinformatic interrogation. At this time, little is known about the parasite glycome or the encoded capacity for glycosylation. This deficit is in spite of the fact that the parasite form associated with chronic infection is heavily glycosylated [17]. Our initial studies have identified a broad spectrum of lectin reactivities [18]. Lectins recognize their specific glycan targets with high specificity and affinity [19]. We were particularly surprised to find evidence for sialylation of the parasite tissue cyst forms given that the genome does not appear to encode recognizable sialyltransferases based on the 'sialylmotif' [5]. This finding suggests that Toxoplasma may hijack the sialyltrasferase activities of the infected host cell or alternatively possess activities with entirely novel functional signatures. The integration of state of the art computational biology and bioinformatics with experimental validation provides a unique opportunity toward new discovery. By conducting a systematic survey of glycosyltransferase activities in silico we can establish both the presence and absence of specific activities in the Toxoplasma genome. Given the evolutionary antiquity of the parasitic protozoa we expect the combination of in silico analysis and experimental validation to offer new insights into the biology of these parasites. The availability of sequenced genomes of several related parasites housed at www.eupathdb.org [20] provides an ideal resource for expanding these studies to other parasites including Plasmodium species, the agent of malaria. In silico identification of potentially unique enzymatic activities could open doors toward the discovery of novel drugs to treat these often deadly infections.",

In addition, each tissue specific network in previous works is isolated and it is not appropriate to analyze diseases associated to multi-tissues like type 2 diabetes (T2D).

All of associations in CODA repository have anatomical contexts covering 71 tissue-cell types. To verify the possibility of uses of CODA to drug development, we selected T2D as a case study.

One of the main challenges to make gene therapy practical in clinical settings is the development of efficient and safe mechanisms to deliver foreign DNA molecules into the nucleus of target cells. Several computational and experimental studies have shown that the design process of synthetic gene transfer vectors can be greatly enhanced by computational modeling and simulation. This paper proposes a novel, effective parallelization of the stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) for pharmacokinetic models that characterize the rate-limiting, multi-step processes of intracellular gene delivery. While efficient parallelizations of the SSA are still an open problem in a general setting, the proposed parallel simulation method is able to substantially accelerate the next reaction selection scheme and the reaction update scheme in the SSA by exploiting and decomposing the structures of stochastic gene delivery models. This, thus, makes computationally intensive analysis such as parameter optimizations and gene dosage control for specific cell types, gene vectors, and transgene expression stability substantially more practical than that could otherwise be with the standard SSA. Here, we translated the nonviral gene delivery model based on mass-action kinetics by Varga et al. [Molecular Therapy, 4(5), 2001] into a more realistic model that captures intracellular fluctuations based on stochastic chemical kinetics, and as a case study we applied our parallel simulation to this stochastic model.

UNIC is an unstructured, deterministic neutron transport code that allows a highly detailed description of a nuclear reactor. The primary goal of our simulation efforts is to reduce the uncertainties and biases in reactor design calculations by progressively replacing existing multilevel averaging (homogenization) techniques with more direct solution methods based on first principles. Since the neutron transport equation is seven dimensional (three in space, two in angle, one in energy, and one in time), these simulations are among the most memory and computationally intensive in all of computational science. In order to model the complex physics of a reactor core, billions of spatial elements, hundreds of angles, and thousands of energy groups are necessary, leading to problem sizes with petascale degrees of freedom. Therefore, these calculations exhaust memory resources on current and even next-generation architectures. In this paper, we present UNIC simulation results for two important representative problems in reactor design and analysis---PHENIX and ZPR-6. In each case, UNIC shows good weak scalability on up to 163,840 cores of Blue Gene/P (Argonne) and 122,800 cores of XT5 (Oak Ridge). While our current per processor performance is less than ideal, we demonstrate a clear ability to effectively utilize the leadership computing platforms. Over the coming months, we aim to improve the per processor performance while maintaining the high parallel efficiency by employing better algorithms such as spatial p- and h-multigrid preconditioners, optimized matrix-tensor operations, and weighted partitioning for better load balancing. Combining these additional algorithmic improvements with the availability of larger parallel machines should allow us to realize our long-term goal of explicit geometry coupled multiphysics reactor simulations. In the long run, these high-fidelity simulations will be able to replace expensive mockup experiments and reduce the uncertainty in crucial reactor design and operational parameters.",

The maintenance efficiency must be improved and human error must be reduced simultaneously to improve NPPs' competitive capability in electricity markets. Although Augmented Reality (AR) offers great possibilities to support NPP maintenance work, some difficulties exist for application of AR to actual work support because current AR systems cannot be implemented in NPP environments without technical improvement. Problems exist such as recognition distance, tracking accuracy, and a complex working environment when applying AR to NPP field work support. Considerable extension of tracking distance and improvement of accuracy are particularly desired because NPPs are large-scale indoor environments. This study designed a linecode marker, a new type of paper-based marker, along with recognition and tracking algorithms for it to resolve these problems. In contrast to conventional paper-based markers, such as square markers and circle markers, the linecode marker is not merely easier to set up in complex industrial environments: it also enables the use of AR in industrial plants because of its considerable tracking-performance improvement. To evaluate tracking accuracy, the trackable distance, and the tracking speed of the proposed tracking method, an evaluation experiment was conducted in a large room. The experiment results show that the tracking distance is extended extremely over that of the traditional marker-based tracking method: tracking accuracy improved to 20 cm in 10 m distance.

We conduct extensive experiments on the publicly available Wikipedia dataset, and demonstrate that, with a memory overhead of 21%, our method can provide 1-3 orders of magnitude improvement in query run-time compared to naive methods and state of the art competing methods.

However, to the best of our knowledge the problem of efficiently finding the maximum dot-product in the general case has never been studied. To this end, we propose two techniques for efficient search -- (i) We index the item vectors in a binary spatial-partitioning metric tree and use a simple branch and-bound algorithm with a novel bounding scheme to efficiently obtain exact solutions. (ii) We use spherical clustering to index the users on the basis of their preferences and pre-compute recommendations only for the representative user of each cluster to obtain extremely efficient approximate solutions. We obtain a theoretical error bound which determines the quality of any approximate result and use it to control the approximation. Both these simple techniques are fairly independent of each other and hence are easily combined to further improve recommendation retrieval efficiency. We evaluate our algorithms on real-world collaborative-filtering datasets, demonstrating more than \u00d77 speedup (with respect to the naive linear search) for the exact solution and over \u00d7250 speedup for approximate solutions by combining both techniques.",

Matrix Factorization (MF) is one of the most popular recommendation approaches; the original user-product rating matrix R with millions of rows and columns is decomposed into a user matrix Q and an item matrix P, such that the product QT P approximates R. Each column q (p) of Q (P) holds the latent factors of the corresponding user (item), and qT p is a prediction of the rating to item p by user q. Recommender systems based on MF suggest to a user in q the items with the top-k scores in qT P. For this problem, we propose a Fast and EXact Inner PROduct retrieval (FEXIPRO) framework, based on sequential scan, which includes three elements. First, FEXIPRO applies an SVD transformation to P, after which the first several dimensions capture a large percentage of the inner products. This enables us to prune item vectors by only computing their partial inner products with q. Second, we construct an integer approximation version of P, which can be used to compute fast upper bounds for the inner products that can prune item vectors. Finally, we apply a lossless transformation to P, such that the resulting matrix has only positive values, allowing for the inner products to be monotonically increasing with dimensionality.

The problems in transmitting high data rate at high speed mobility are how to provide wide bandwidth in rapidly changing channel condition, to mitigate selective fading problems, to estimate response of the channel, and to solve degradation of signal performance. We propose a comprehensive solution for those problems, i.e. modified MC-CDMA inner coding system model in MIMO wireless systems. We also consider that this system can accommodate multi user with multi services, various bandwidth usage, QoS or channel response for every user. The simulation result shows that the MIMO wireless system with the proposed inner coding in non coherent channel transmission scheme provides a good system performance. The proposed scheme can outperform other previously published inner coding schemes for high mobility, high Eb/N0 and multi user conditions.",

Having originated from an alpha-proteobacterial endosymbiont, these eukaryotic organelles contain small and extremely variable genomes, and are thus perfect model systems for the much more complex eubacterial and archaeal genomes. We are currently in vestigating mitochondrial DNAs (mtDNAs) in a lineage of unicellular, primitive protistan eukaryotes, the jakobids, with the aim to understand the evolution of mitochondrial genomes, genes and their regulation. Because these organisms are difficult to grow, biochemical approaches aimed at understanding gene regulation are laborious, thus it is possible to capitalize considerably from predictions on genome and gene organization, and regulatory elements. Contrary to approaches in which molecular data (gene order, sequence similarities) are used to infer the phylogenetic relationships among a group of organism, we know their phylogeny and employ this information to identify and model more or less conserved genetic elements and structural RNA genes that are difficult to spot by conventional methods, in a phylogenetic-comparative approach.",

It is within this setting that one seeks to build an integrated view of the system under study, as soon as the relevant units and the complex inter- and intra-level relationships in which these units participate have been characterized. Implicit in the above outline are the assumptions that a) a complete and presumably correct list of parts exists for the system that is being studied; and, b) most, if not all, of the relevant relationships involving these parts are available.

Currently, two pathways for activating caspases have been studied in detail. One starts with ligation of a death ligand to its transmembrane death receptor, followed by recruitment and activation of caspases in the death-inducing signaling complex. The second pathway involves the participation of mitochondria, which release caspase-activating proteins into the cytosol, thereby forming the apoptosome where caspases will bind and become activated. In addition, two other apoptotic pathways are emerging: endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis and caspase-independent apoptosis.

However, edges in graphs cannot represent multi-way interactions among molecules, which occur very often within cells. Hypergraphs may be better representations for such interactions, since hyperedges can naturally represent relationships among multiple molecules. Here we propose using hypergraphs to capture the uncertainty that is inherent in reverse engineering gene-gene networks from systems biology datasets. Some subsets of nodes may induce highly varying subgraphs across an ensemble of high-scoring networks inferred by a reverse engineering algorithm. We provide a novel formulation of hyperedges to capture this uncertainty in network topology. We propose a clustering-based approach to discover hyperedges. We show that our approach can recover hyperedges planted in synthetic datasets with high precision and recall. We apply our techniques to a published dataset of pathway structures inferred from quantitative genetic interaction data in S. cerevisiae related to the unfolded protein response in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Our approach discovers several hyperedges that capture the uncertain connectivity of genes in specific pathways and complexes related to the ER. Our work demonstrates that molecular interaction hypergraphs are powerful representations for capturing uncertainty in network structure. The hyperedges we discover directly suggest groups of genes for which further experiments may be required in order to precisely discover interaction patterns.",

Today, with the advent of modern genetics and molecular biology, this same principle has been applied across countless brain areas and a broad set of questions about the anatomical configuration, function, development, and plasticity of the nervous system. Many of the most powerful and commonly employed tools--like Green Fluorescence Protein, Channelrhodopsin, and virus-mediated tracing of neuronal projections--are actually biological solutions to completely unrelated problems, such as how to get a jellyfish to glow green, how to convey photosensitivity to a unicellular organism, or how to spread the Rabies virus across an entire nervous system. These research tools, the product of millions of years of evolution (and a few years of human tinkering) yield datasets whose explanatory power draws from the fact that they, like the Golgi Stain, allow researchers to focus on the question at hand and filter out the surrounding noise.",

We analyzed spiking in granule cells via a detailed computational model and computed the spiking-potentiation contributing to signal recoding in granular layer. Plasticity is simulated in the granule cell model by changing the intrinsic excitability and release probability of the cells. Excitatory post synaptic potentials and spikes on varying Golgi cell (GoC) inhibition and Mossy fiber(MF) excitation were analyzed simultaneously with the effect of induced plasticity changes based on the timing and amplitude of the postsynaptic signals. It is found that a set of EPSPs reaching maximum threshold amplitude are converted to less number of high amplitude EPSPs or spikes. Exploring the EPSP-spike complex in granular neurons reveal possible mechanisms and quantification of information encoding in individual neurons of the cerebellar granular layer.
