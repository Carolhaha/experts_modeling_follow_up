The aim of this study is to derive a more precise estimation of any association in a meta-analysis. We searched the PubMed database (up to 6 June 2014) for studies regarding the association of IL-27 polymorphisms (rs153109, rs17855750 and rs181206) and the risk of cancer in Chinese population. Odds ratios (ORs) together with their 95 confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by using random/fixed effect model to assess the association. Sensitivity analyses were used to assess the stability of the results. Beggs test was performed to measure publication bias. A total of six eligible studies with 1684 patients and 1837 controls were included in this meta-analysis. IL-27 rs153109 polymorphism was significantly associated with cancer risk in Chinese population (GG versus AA: OR1.24, 95 CI1.001.54, p 0.05). However, there were no associations between IL-27 rs17855750 and rs181206 polymorphisms and cancer risk in Chinese population.

In order to improve the accuracy, selected compounds were subjected into Quantum Polarized Ligand Docking (QPLD) docking, for which the results showed high docking score, compared to glide docking score. QPLD is more accurate as it includes charges in the scoring function, which was not available in the glide docking. Binding energy calculation results also indicated that selected compounds have good binding capacity with the target protein. In addition, these compounds on screening have good absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity property.

Interestingly, the use of phytochemicals in the treatment of cancer as an alternative to synthetic drugs comes with a host of advantages; minimum side effects, good human absorption and low toxicity to normal cells. Protease activated receptor 1 (PAR1) has been established as a promising target in many diseases including various cancers. Strong evidences suggest its role in metastasis also. Objective : There are no natural compounds known to inhibit its activity, so we aimed to identify phytochemicals with antagonist activity against PAR1. Methods : We screened phytochemicals from Naturally Occurring Plant-based Anticancer Compound-Activity-Target database (NPACT, http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/npact/ ) against PAR1 using virtual screening workflow of Schrdinger software. It analyzes pharmaceutically relevant properties using Qikprop and calculates binding energy using Glide at three accuracy levels (high-throughput virtual screening, standard precision and extra precision). Results and conclusion : Our study led to the identification of phytochemicals, which showed interaction with at least one experimentally determined active site residue of PAR1, showed no violations to Lipinski's rule of five along with predicted high human absorption. Furthermore, structural interaction fingerprint analysis indicated that the residues H255, D256, E260, S344, V257, L258, L262, Y337 and S344 may play an important role in the hydrogen bond interactions of the phytochemicals screened. Of these residues, H255 and L258 residues were experimentally proved to be important for antagonist binding. The residues Y183, L237, L258, L262, F271, L332, L333, Y337, L340, A349, Y350, A352, and Y353 showed maximum hydrophobic interactions with the phytochemicals screened. The results of this work suggest that phytochemicals Reissantins D, 24,25-dihydro-27-desoxywithaferin A, Isoguaiacin, 20-hydroxy-12-deoxyphorbol angelate, etc. could be potential antagonist of PAR1.

Though the ligands for these receptors are presently unidentified, they are thought to be constitutively active. NR4A acts as molecular switches in gene regulation and their action is increasingly seen to be modulated by complex network of cellular signaling pathways. Members of the NR4A are expressed in tissue-specific fashion which indicates their selective control of various biological processes. Data reveal a host of functions governed by the NR4A subfamily members including general metabolism, immunity, cellular stress, memory, insulin sensitivity and cardiac homeostasis by regulating specific target genes whose products participates in such processes. Moreover, these receptors have a role in the onset and progression of various diseases such as various types of cancer, inflammation, atherosclerosis and obesity.

These cells present specializations from tissue to tissue, determining different structures and functions. Tissues formed by epithelial cells are characterized by the few extracellular matrix found between adjacent cells. In this way, to preserve tissue integrity, cells have to stick to each other and have to maintain a strict communication with the environment via cell junctions. Signal transduction is the main way of cell communication, being vital for the regulation of cell survival and proliferation. In cell junctions, this communication occurs through cell adhesion molecules that promote cell-to-cell and cell-to-extracellular matrix adhesion, as well as, enable the flow of information to the inside and to the outside of the cell. These molecules include integrins and cadherins, among others. The impairment of cell signaling in epithelial junctions has been involved in several pathological processes that underlie the development of, for example, colorectal cancer. Thus, epithelial cell signaling mediators have been explored as potential therapeutic targets and efforts have been made to achieve a deeper understanding of molecular events that occur at cell junctions. In this review, we address the current knowledge on the main signaling events that take place in anchoring junctions of epithelial cells, focusing both on cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix interactions. To conclude, we explore some relevant consequences from epithelial cell signaling impairment and demonstrate that the molecular mediators of the pathways analyzed may be putative therapeutic targets.",

In this study, we evaluate the effect of two fertilizing drugs, clomiphene citrate and estradiol, on the activation of Erk1/2 and the viability of two breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 (hormone dependent) and BT20 (hormone independent).We show that both drugs induce Erk1/2 phosphorylation in MCF-7 and BT20 cells despite their opposite effect on cell viability. In fact, clomiphene citrate is significantly proapoptotic while estradiol promotes cell proliferation. The fact that phospho-Erk1/2 is a common element to both mechanisms suggests that specific factors deciding between proliferation and apoptosis must be operative downstream of this signaling pathway.",

In this study, we employed a systems biology approach to unveil the most significant events and key molecular mediators of ophthalmic sequelae caused by atherosclerosis. Literature mining was used to identify the proteins involved in both atherosclerosis and ophthalmic diseases. A proteinprotein interaction (PPI) network was prepared using the literature-mined seed nodes. Network topological analysis was carried out using Cytoscape, while network nodes were annotated using database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery in order to identify the most enriched pathways and processes. Network analysis revealed that mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1) and protein kinase C occur with highest betweenness centrality, degree and closeness centrality, thus reflecting their functional importance to the network. Our analysis shows that atherosclerosis-associated ophthalmic complications are caused by the convergence of neurotrophin signaling pathways, multiple immune response pathways and focal adhesion pathway on the MAPK signaling pathway. The PPI network shares features with vasoregression, a process underlying multiple vascular eye diseases. Our study presents a first clear and composite picture of the components and crosstalk of the main pathways of atherosclerosis-induced ocular diseases.

Objective : To determine the role of beta-arrestin1 in cannabinoid activity. Materials and methods : Beta-arrestin1 / mice and their wild-type (/) counterparts were assayed for antinociceptive and temperature-decreasing effects of two ligands, 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and CP55940, after both single and repeated administration. In vitro assays examined the effects of deletion on CB 1 receptor density, agonist-binding and G-protein activation. Results : Deletion of beta-arrestin1 diminished the effects of CP55940 in both antinociception (latency to tail withdrawal) and temperature-depression assays in mice. However, deleting beta-arrestin1 had no effect on the actions of THC in either assay. Antagonist radioligand ([ 3 H]SR141716A) saturation binding indicated no difference between beta-arrestin1 / and / mice in the density or affinity for cannabinoid CB 1 receptors in brain membranes. CP55940 agonist binding in brain membranes from beta-arrestin1 / mice exhibited high- and intermediate-affinity sites, but beta-arrestin1 / membranes exhibited an additional site with low affinity. CP55940 produced greater stimulation of [ 35 S]GTPS binding to membranes from whole brain of beta-arrestin1 / than / mice. The rates of the development of tolerance to chronic THC or CP55940 administration did not appear to be affected by genotype. Discussion : Beta-arrestin1 appeared to mediate the actions of CP55940, but did not affect the activity of THC.

Recently, a new class of receptors has been reported, called orphan receptors because the associated ligand and signaling pathways are unknown, these receptors have been associated with certain pathologies. Therefore, the aim of this work was to study the expression of the orphan receptors GPR22 and GPR162 in heart, aorta, brain and kidney of diabetic rats. Materials and methods : We used Wistar male rats with 1012 weeks of age. Diabetes was induced by a single dose of streptozotocin (60mg/kg i.p.). After four weeks, the tissue was obtained and the expression of the mRNA was measured by RT-PCR.

Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a potent mitogen involved in cell proliferation and migration. PDGF-BB induces the proliferation and migration of PASMCs and has been proposed to be a key mediator in the progression of PAH. Previous studies have shown that PDGF and its receptor are substantially elevated in lung tissues and PASMCs isolated from patients and animals with PAH, but the underlying mechanisms are still poorly manifested.

Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine whether PDGF-BB on cell proliferation process is mediated through the MAP kinases pathway in human PASMCs (HPASMCs). Our results showed PDGF-BB-induced proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), Cyclin A and Cyclin E expression in a concentration-dependent manner.

Notch signaling plays a crucial role during embryogenesis. Several studies showed that Notch is expressed in adulthood. Objective : The aim of our study was to confirm the involvement of Notch signaling in human OA at in vitro and ex vivo levels. Materials and methods : Normal human articular chondrocytes were cultured during four passages either treated or not with a Notch inhibitor: DAPT. Human OA cartilage was cultured with DAPT for five days. Chondrocytes secreted markers and some Notch pathway components were analyzed using Western blotting and qPCR. Results : Passaging chondrocytes induced a decrease in the cartilage markers: colII and aggrecan. DAPT-treated chondrocytes and OA cartilage showed a significant increase in healthy cartilage markers. De-differentiation markers, colI, MMP13 and eNOS, were significantly reduced in DAPT-treated chondrocytes and OA cartilage. Notch1 expression was proportional to colI, MMP13 and eNOS expression and inversely proportional to colII and aggrecan expression in nontreated cultured chondrocytes. Notch ligand: Jagged1 increased in chondrocytes culture. DAPT treatment resulted in reduced Jagged1 expression. Notch target gene HES1 increased during chondrocyte culture and was reduced when treated with DAPT.

Recently, new information regarding the role of ERs in physiology, pathology and the mechanisms through which estrogens bring about these functions has emerged. The physiological effects of estrogen are manifested through two ER isoforms ER and ER which display distinct regions of sequence homology. The crystal structures of these receptors bound to their specific ligands (e.g. agonists or antagonists) have revealed much about how ligand binding alters receptor structure/conformation and the interaction with coactivators or corepressors as well as how it determines the cellular response to a ligand. ERs are involved in the variety of physiological and pathological activities and different cells and tissues have shown divergent responses to these two receptor isoforms. The discovery of sub-isoforms of ER alpha and beta has further complicated our understanding of how the interaction between ERs and its ligands contribute to the development of disease.

Objective : We attempted to create a new mouse model for COPD by intra-tracheal administration of a mixture of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and cigarette smoke solution (CSS), and investigated the importance of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38) pathway in the pathogenesis of COPD. Methods : Mice were administered LPSCSS once a day on days 04 and 711. Thereafter, CSS alone was administered to mice once a day on days 1418. On day 28, histopathological changes of the lung were evaluated, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was subjected to western blot array for cytokines. Transgenic (TG) mice expressing a constitutive-active form of MKK6, a p38-specific activator in the lung, were subjected to our experimental protocol of COPD model. Results : LPSCSS administration induced enlargement of alveolar air spaces and destruction of lung parenchyma. BALF analyses of the LPSCSS group revealed an increase in expression levels of several cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of human COPD. These results suggest that our experimental protocol can induce COPD in mice. Likewise, histopathological findings of the lung and induction of cytokines in BALF from MKK6 c.a.-TG mice were more marked than those in WT mice.

In this study, we investigated the involvement of iNOS in the process of IGF-1-induced inhibition of PASMC apoptosis. We also examined the role of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in the IGF-1-induced iNOS activation. Our results show that exogenous IGF-1 induced the up-regulation of iNOS in PASMC. Immunofluorescence of IGF-1 and iNOS showed a decreased immunostaining of both IGF-1 and iNOS in the cytoplasm and the perinucleus under serum deprivation condition. iNOS inhibition in PASMC in vitro markedly induced IGF-1-mediated anti-apoptosis as assessed by the cell viability measurement, Western blot, mitochondrial potential analysis and nuclear morphology determination. A p38 MAPK inhibitor blocked all the effects of IGF-1 on iNOS. Our findings suggest that IGF-1 inhibits cells apoptosis in PASMC by activating the p38 MAPKiNOS transduction pathway.

We aimed to examine the effects on TRPM2 and TRPM7 gene expression of C(60)HyFn due to marked antioxidant activity in HHcy mice. Methods : C57BL/6 J. mice were divided into four groups: (1) Control group, (2) HHcy, (3) HHcyC(60)HyFn-treated group and (4) C(60)HyFn-treated group. TRPM2 and TRPM7 gene expression in brains of mice were detected by real-time PCR, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Apoptosis in brain were assessed by TUNEL staining. Results : mRNA expression levels of TRPM2 were significantly increased in HHcy group compared to the control group. C(60)HyFn administration significantly decreased serum levels of homocysteine and TRPM2 mRNA levels in HHcyC(60)HyFn group. Whereas, HHcy-treatment and C(60)HyFn administration did not change the expression of TRPM7. Conclusion : Administration of C(60)HyFn in HHcy mice significantly reduces serum homocysteine level, neuronal apoptosis and expression level of TRPM2 gene.

This promotes matrix degradation and unsuccessful cartilage repair. WNT signaling constitutes one of the most critical biological processes during cell fate assignment and homeostasis. Objectives : This review aims to give an insight on results from the studies that were interested in the involvement of WNT in OA. Methods : Studies were selected through a pubmed search. Results : Recent genetic data showed that aberration in WNT signaling may be involved in OA. WNT signals are transduced through at least three cascades: the canonical WNT/-catenin pathway, the WNT/Ca 2 pathway and the WNT/planar cell polarity pathway. Most of the studies used in-vitro models to elucidate the involvement of WNT in the physiopathology of OA. These studies analyzed the expression pattern of WNT pathway components during OA such as WNT5, WNT7, co-receptor LRP, -catenin, WNT target genes (c-jun, cyclins) and/or the interaction of these components with the secretion of OA most important markers such as IL-1, collagens, MMPs. Results from these studies are in favor of a deep involvement of the WNT signaling in the physiopathology of OA either by having a protective or a destructive role.

On the other hand, the binding of a full agonist resulted in a significant shift of the initial equilibrium towards its active state. Finally, the binding of the inverse agonist stabilized the receptor in its inactive state. It is likely that the binding of inverse agonists might be a universal way of constitutive activity inhibition in vivo . Our results indicate that ligand binding redistribute pre-existing conformational degrees of freedom (in accordance to the MonodWymanChangeux Model) of the receptor rather than cause induced fit in it. Therefore, the ensemble of biologically relevant receptor conformations is encoded in its spatial structure, and individual conformations from that ensemble might be used by the cell in conformity with the physiological behavior.",

Renal interstitial fibrosis (RIF) is a hallmark of common progressive chronic diseases which lead to renal failure. This study was performed to investigate whether there was a potential signal pathway between PAX2 and CD2AP in RIF rats induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). Eighty Wistar male rats were divided into two groups randomly: sham operation group (SHO) and model group subjected to UUO (GU), n 40. The model was established by left ureteral ligation. Renal tissues were collected at 14 d and 28 d after surgery. RIF index, cell apoptosis index, protein expression of PAX2, CD2AP, transforming growth factor-l (TGF-1), collagen-IV (Col-IV), fibronectin (FN) in renal interstitium and renal tissue, and mRNA expression of PAX2, CD2AP, and TGF-1 in renal tissue were detected. Compared with that in the SHO group, the PAX2 and CD2AP expressions (mRNA and protein) were significantly increased ( p &lt;0.01). Protein expressions of TGF-1, Col-IV, and FN, and RIF index or cell apoptosis index in the GU group were markedly elevated than those in the SHO group (all p &lt;0.01). PAX2 or CD2AP was positively correlated with TGF-1, Col-IV, and FN, and RIF index or cell apoptosis index (all p &lt;0.05). Furthermore, PAX2 was positively correlated with CD2AP ( p &lt;0.05).

We also examined the hBD-2-inducible activity of acid-electrolyzed functional water (FW). The results indicated that both dsRNA- and FW-induced hBD-2 expression in OECs. The induction efficiency was much higher for FW than for dsRNA. FW-induced production of hBD-2 was clearly observed by immunofluorescence staining. A luciferase assay was performed with 1.2kb of the 5-untranslated region (5-UTR) of the hBD-2 gene. The results indicated that the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-B)-binding site proximal to the translation initiation site was indispensable for dsRNA-stimulated hBD-2 expression, but not in the case of FW. Moreover, FW-stimulated hBD-2 expression did not depend on NF-B activity; instead, FW inhibited NF-B activity. Pretreatment of the cells with specific inhibitors against NF-B further confirmed NF-B-independent hBD-2 induction by FW. In analogy to the results for intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), the dsRNA signal, but not FW, was sensed by toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) in OECs.

Materials and methods : We used brainstem astrocytes as a model system to determine whether Ang II and Ang III induce p38 MAP kinase protein phosphorylation. Results : Treatment of astrocytes with increasing concentrations of both peptides caused a dose-dependent increase in p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation. The effect of Ang II and Ang III was maximal at 10nM and 100nM concentrations, respectively. The effects of the peptides were rapid occurring within minutes of treatment. There was a significant difference in the ability of the peptides to induce p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation. The ability of Ang II to induce p38 MAP kinase was almost twice than that of Ang III, suggesting that Ang II was more potent than Ang III in this effect. Ang AT 1 receptor mediated the actions of the peptides since pretreatment with losartan prevented p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation by Ang II and Ang III. In addition, blockade of Ang II metabolism to Ang III with the aminopeptidase A inhibitor glutamate phosphonate was ineffective in ameliorating Ang II phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase, suggesting that Ang II directly stimulated p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation.

In this study, cellular signaling of tau phosphorylation induced by A and the inhibiting effects of curcumin on this signaling were investigated on human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. The results indicated that curcumin inhibits A-induced tau phosphorylation at Thr231 and Ser396, over-expression of HDAC6, and decrease in phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) at Ser9. However, the protective effect of curcumin on dephosphorylation of GSK-3 induced by A is not directly related to cellular oxidative stress.

Furthermore, insulin receptor/phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase pathway, as a regulatory signaling of second message PIP3, does not participate in A-induced deactivation of Akt (dephosphorylation at Thr308 and Ser473).

Methods : Fetal lung fibroblasts were isolated from wild-type and EGFR knockout mice and exposed to physiologic stretch (2.5 elongation) or injurious stretch (20 distention). Cells were evaluated for necrosis, apoptosis, proliferation and inflammation. Results : Injurious stretch increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release to similar degree in wild-type and knockout cells. In contrast, 20 stretch increased cleaved caspase-3 and decreased proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) only in wild-type cells. Furthermore, 20 stretch increased macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) by 35 fold in wild-type cells. In contrast, in knockout cells MIP-2 decreased by 50 and MCP-1 only increased by 60 when compared to physiologic stretch. Conclusion : Our data show a decrease of apoptosis and inflammation and absence of decreased proliferation after injurious stretch of fetal fibroblasts lacking EGFR.

This study was performed to study the potential signal pathway of ATRA in the expression of matrix metalloproteinases-2 (MMP-2) and matrix metalloproteinases-9 (MMP-9) in injury podocyte. Cells were divided into three groups: group of negative control (NC), group of injury podocyte induced by adriamycin (ADR) (AI) and group of ADR inducing podocyte injury model treated with ATRA (AA). The cells morphology changes were detected using microscope and scanning electron microscopy. MMP-2 and MMP-9 enzymic activity was detected using the gelatin zymography method. Protein and mRNA expressions of MMP-2, MMP-9, RAR-, RAR- and RAR- were measured by western-blot and real-time RT-PCR. Enzymatic activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in group AA was significantly enhanced compared to AI group after ATRA-treated 24h ( p &lt;0.05). The protein and mRNA expressions of MMP-2/MMP-9 in group AA were significantly increased than those in group AI at both 12 and 24h time points ( p &lt;0.05). Compared to group AI, RAR- and RAR- protein/mRNA expressions of group AA were significantly increased at both 12 and 24h time points ( p &lt;0.05). There was no difference for the expression of RAR- between group AI and group AA ( p &gt;0.05). RAR- protein level was positively correlated with MMP-2 or MMP-9 protein expression ( p &lt;0.05), and RAR- protein level was also positively correlated with MMP-2 or MMP-9 protein expression ( p &lt;0.05). In conclusion, ATRA may increase expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 by the potential signal pathway of RAR- and RAR- in injury podocyte induced by adriamycin, but not RAR-.",

Our laboratory has demonstrated that 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE) is a key factor in hypoxia-induced PA remodeling and can increase PASMC intracellular Ca 2 ([Ca 2 ] i ) in rats. It is possible that NFATc3 is related with the function of 15-HETE anti-apoptosis during hypoxia. Our results identified that NFATc3 was mainly localized in rat PASMCs and was upregulated in PAs during hypoxia-induced rat pulmonary hypertension (PH), while this effect was inhibited by administration of nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), a 15-lipoxygenase (15-LO) inhibitor. Moreover, hypoxia and exogenous 15-HETE promoted the expression and nuclear translocation of NFATc3 in PASMCs, which was inhibited by NDGA or small interfering RNA targeted to rat 15-LO1 or 15-LO2. Furthermore, endogenous 15-HETE induced by hypoxia and exogenous 15-HETE suppressed serum deprivation-induced loss of rat PASMCs survival and prevented annexin V binding, mitochondrial membrane potential depolarization, DNA nick end labeling and chromatin condensation.

Recent advances in combinatorial protein engineering mean it is now possible to develop protein scaffolds that could substitute for whole antibody-associated properties as emerging therapeutic proteins. In particular, disulfide-rich proteins are attractive templates for directed evolution in the search for novel molecules because they can regulate the activities of receptors, enzymes, and other molecules. Previously, we demonstrated that functional regulatory molecules against interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) could be obtained by directed evolution of the three-finger toxin (3F) scaffold. In the present study, trypsin was selected as a target for directed evolution to further explore the potential use of the 3F cDNA display library. After seven rounds of selection, the DNA sequences converged. The recombinant proteins produced by the selected candidates had inhibitory activity against trypsin ( K i of 33450nM). Three of the six groups had K i values that were comparable to bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor and soybean trypsin inhibitor. Two of the candidates also had inhibitory effects against chymotrypsin and kallikrein. This study suggests that 3F protein is suitable for the preparation of high-diversity libraries that can be utilized to obtain protease inhibitors.

Objective : Until now the mechanisms by which hypoxia promotes the progression of CRC are far from well understood. Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is a crucial mediator and over-expressed in CRC patients. But whether ILK is involved in the process that hypoxia promotes CRC cells growth and silencing the ILK gene results in CRC cells apoptosis is not clear. Materials and methods: Lentivirus transfection, invasion assay, TUNEL assay, Bromodeoxyuridine incorporation and mitochondrial function assay were applied to demonstrate our hypothesis. Results: In this study, we found that hypoxia induced the expression of ILK in a time-dependent manner, and after knocking down ILK expression with ILK shRNA, the cells proliferation promoted by hypoxia was inhibited in HT29 cell line. Moreover, blocking the ILK pathway led to caspase-3 and caspase-9 activations, the decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential, and cells apoptosis. And the inhibitory effects of hypoxia on cells apoptosis were mediated by the ILK pathway. In addition, hypoxia promoted HT29 cells metastasis and invasion through the ILK pathway.

While mGluR expression has been investigated largely in the DRG, the present study focused on mGluR expression on neurons and satellite glial cells (SGCs) of the trigeminal ganglion (TG). Materials and methods : To address the presence of mGluRs in rat TG neurons and their corresponding SGCs, the trigeminal ganglia from six adult male Wistar rats were isolated and immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry were performed. The expression of mGluR1-, mGluR2/3- and mGluR8 on TG neurons and SGCs was investigated in tissue slices and isolated cells. Results : 35.16.0 of the TG neurons were positive for mGluR1, whereas 39.97.7 and 55.56.3 were positive for mGluR2/3 and mGluR8, respectively. Immunoreactive neurons expressing mGluRs were mainly medium- to large sized, with a smaller population of small-sized neurons showing immunoreactivity. The SGCs showed immunoreactivity toward mGluR1 and mGluR8, but not mGluR2/3, both in the tissue and in isolated cells. Conclusions : Findings from the present study showed that trigeminal neurons express mGluR1, mGluR2/3 and mGluR8, while SGCs only express mGluR1 and mGluR8. This novel evidence may advance investigations on a possible role of mGluRs in relation to trigeminal pain transmission within the craniofacial region.",

Objective : RGS2 knockout (RGS2KO) mice are hypertensive and show arteriolar remodeling. VSMC proliferation modulates intracellular Ca 2 concentration [Ca 2 ]i. RGS2 involvement in VSMC proliferation had not been examined. Methods : Thymidine incorporation and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) conversion assays measured cell proliferation. Fura-2 ratiometric imaging quantified [Ca 2 ]i before and after UTP and thapsigargin. [ 3 H]-labeled inositol was used for phosphoinositide hydrolysis. Quantitative RT-PCR and confocal immunofluorescence of select Ca 2 transporters was performed in primary aortic VSMC. Results and discussion : Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) increased S -phase entry and proliferation in VSMC from RGS2KO mice to a greater extent than in VSMC from wild-type (WT) controls. Consistent with differential PDGF-induced changes in Ca 2 homeostasis, RGS2KO VSMC showed lower resting [Ca 2 ]i but higher thapsigargin-induced [Ca 2 ]i as compared with WT. RGS2KO VSMC expressed lower mRNA levels of plasma membrane Ca 2 ATPase-4 (PMCA4) and Na Ca 2 Exchanger (NCX), but higher levels of sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 ATPase-2 (SERCA2). Western blot and immunofluorescence revealed similar differences in PMCA4 and SERCA2 protein, while levels of NCX protein were not reduced in RGS2KO VSMC. Consistent with decreased Ca 2 efflux activity, 45 Ca-extrusion rates were lower in RGS2KO VSMC. These differences were reversed by the PMCA inhibitor La 3 , but not by replacing extracellular Na with choline, implicating differences in the activity of PMCA and not NCX. Conclusion : RGS2-deficient VSMC exhibit higher rates of proliferation and coordinate plasticity of Ca 2 -handling mechanisms in response to PDGF stimulation.",

Materials : Cultured PC12 cells were subjected to 0, 15 and 70mmHg hydrostatic pressure for 1 and 24h. Then, the following values were analyzed: (a) cell viability; (b) lipid peroxidation and intracellular reactive oxygen species production; (c) mitochondrial membrane depolarization; (d) cell apoptosis; (e) caspase-3 and caspase-9 activities; (f) reduced glutathione (GSH) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px). Results : The hydrostatic pressures (15 and 70mmHg) increased oxidative cell damage through a decrease of GSH and GSH-Px values, and increasing mitochondrial membrane potential. Additionally, 70mmHg hydrostatic pressure for 24h indicated highest apoptotic effects, as demonstrated by plate reader analyses of apoptosis, caspase-3 and -9 values.

However, integrins are primarily involved in the blood vessel growth and repair. Therefore, integrins are promising angiogenesis targets. Integrins are receptors on cell surface, involved in signal transduction and attachments in extra cellular matrix (ECM). IntegrinV3 and V5 are implicated in tumor angiogenesis, metastasis, inflammation and bone resorption. The crystal structure of integrinv5 is not available in protein structural databases, therefore; molecular model of integrin5 structure was prepared and stereo chemical model quality was checked. Integrin 5 active sites were identified based on insilico analysis tools. Further, molecular level interactions between integrin5 and ECM proteins were predicted. In the present study ECM proteins such as focal adhesion kinase 1 (FAK1), annexin A5 and P21 activated kinase 4 (PAK4) were considered for protein-protein docking, to understand inter molecular interactions. The predicted model is conceived to be stereo chemically good and can be used for molecular interaction studies of angiogenic inhibitors.",

Abnormal expression of Notch receptors has been associated with many epithelial metaplastic and neoplastic lesions. Objective-materials and methods : In this particular study, it was determined the relative gene expression of Notch receptors after knockdown experiments in colon cancer stem cells (CSCs) and the gene expression changes in stemness transcription factors (Oct4, Sox2, Nanog), as well in dipeptidylpeptidase-4, CD44 antigen, Met proto-oncogene and in Metnase transposase. Results : In control CSCs Notch-2 had the higher expression, followed by Notch-1, Notch-3. Notch-4 demonstrated the lower gene expression among the receptors. The suppression of Notch-1 led to increased expression of Oct4 and Sox2, but in decreased gene expression of cMET, Setmar and CD44. The CD26 expression remained unchanged. The knockdown of Notch-2 led to decreased expression of all transcription factors. Notch-3 down regulation caused increased Oct4 gene expression, but decreased levels for the rest of the genes. Finally, the suppression of Notch-4 had the same effect as in receptor Notch-3. Discussion and conclusion : The above experimental data suggest the possible interaction between the four different receptors of Notch signaling pathway. The expression of CD26, cMET and N-methyltransferase Setmar was also changed. Finally, the stemness phenotype was changed in a different way each time, according to the receptor that was down regulated.

Considering different endocrine and paracrine functions of bile acids, the current review focuses on the role of TGR5 as a novel pharmacological target in the metabolic syndrome and related disorders, such as diabetes, obesity, atherosclerosis, liver diseases and cancer. TGR5 ligands improve insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis through the secretion of incretins. The bile acid/TGR5/cAMP signaling pathway increases energy expenditure in brown adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. Activation of TGR5 in macrophages inhibits production of proinflammatory cytokines and attenuates the development of atherosclerosis. This receptor has been detected in many cell types of the liver where it has anti-inflammatory effects, thus reducing liver steatosis and damage. TGR5 also modulates hepatic microcirculation and fluid secretion in the biliary tree. In cell culture models TGR5 has been linked to signaling pathways involved in metabolism, cell survival, proliferation and apoptosis, which suggest a possible role of TGR5 in cancer development. Despite the fact that TGR5 ligands may represent novel drugs for prevention and treatment of different aspects of the metabolic syndrome, clinical studies are awaited with the perspective that they will complete TGR5 biology and identify efficient and safe TGR5 agonists.",

Objective: To determine whether PKD is activated in response to LPA administration in myoblasts, and to define the signaling pathways that mediate LPA-stimulated PKD phosphorylation. Methods: C2C12 myoblasts were treated with LPA and signaling pathways examined by means of Western immunoblotting and real-time PCR (RT-PCR). Pharmacological inhibition and RNA-interference were used to target specific molecules to determine their involvement in LPA-induced PKD phosphorylation. Results: Treatment of myoblasts with exogenous LPA revealed that PI3K p110 mediated PKD phosphorylation at Ser 748 and at Ser 916 through kinase-dependent and kinase-independent mechanisms. Loss of PKC, but not the loss of PKC, prevented LPA-induced PKD phosphorylation. The PKD isoform responsive to LPA treatment was identified as PKD2.

To assess TNF- receptor (TNFR) expression, it is important to estimate both the number of cells that carry these receptors and the number of receptors per cell, because the cell fate depends on the balance between TNFRI and TNFRII signaling. Objective : The aim of the present study was to develop an optimized protocol to estimate the level of expression of membrane-bound TNFRI and TNFRII, using QuantiBRITE PE calibration beads. Materials and methods : The percentage of cells that expressed membrane-bound TNFRI and TNFRII and the mean number of receptors per cell were determined by flow cytometry using PE-labeled antibodies against TNFR. To create a calibration curve and convert cell fluorescence intensity values to absolute numbers of receptors, we used QuantiBRITE PE beads. Results : CD19 B lymphocytes had the least percentage of cells expressing TNFRI and the greatest number of receptor molecules per cell, whereas CD3 T lymphocytes had the greatest percentage of cells expressing TNFRII and the lowest density of these receptors. We also established that stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) significantly increased the number of TNFRI and TNFRII on CD14 monocytes.

Increasing evidence suggest that the expression of certain RGS proteins is changed dramatically in various cancers, and in some instances, the control of cancer cell proliferation or migration by RGS proteins has been demonstrated. We assessed if common trends might exist in the expression of various RGS proteins in several types of cancer by examining microarray data using the Oncomine database. We focused on the largest R4 sub-family of RGS proteins, containing RGS1, RGS2, RGS3, RGS4, RGS5, RGS8, RGS13, RGS16 and RGS18. This analysis suggests that a number (up to 6) of RGS transcripts are exclusively downregulated in certain cancers, while being exclusively upregulated in other cancer types. Furthermore, significant changes in the expression of certain RGS proteins trended toward the same direction across various cancers. To illustrate, RGS1 is largely upregulated, whereas RGS2 is downregulated in the majority of solid tumors, whereas RGS5 transcripts are greatly increased in eight subtypes of lymphoma with no reports of downregulation in hematological malignancies.

At the molecular level, activation of -adrenergic receptors (AR) increases calcium influx into cardiac myocytes by activating protein kinase A (PKA), leading to subsequent phosphorylation of L-type calcium channels. In the case of the 2 AR, this process is facilitated by the presence of A-Kinase Anchoring Proteins (AKAPs) that serve as scaffolding proteins for the L-type calcium channel and the 2 AR complex. Our work has shown that, in addition to facilitating PKA phosphorylation of the channel, AKAPs also promote an increase in the Cav1.2 channel surface expression.

At the moment, most of the studies find that apoE not only acts as a ligand for metabolism of lipids, but also plays as a factor to regulate lots of signaling pathways. There was rare review to sum up the signaling pathways for apoE, and there was also rare review to widely review the gene expression of apoE in glomerulus diseases. This review was performed to provide a relatively complete signaling pathways flowchart for apoE to the investigators who were interested in the roles of apoE in the pathogenesis of glomerulus diseases. In the past decades, some studies were also performed to explore the association of apoE gene expression with the risk of glomerulus diseases.

While much research has been dedicated to elucidating the mechanisms regulating Kir3 channel gating, little is known regarding the channels early associations with signaling partners, its stability at the plasma membrane or mechanisms regulating its internalization and degradation. To address these issues we have established an inducible Kir3.1 cell line that allows monitoring of a discrete pulse of channel as it progresses along the biosynthetic pathway. Using this system, we have been able to track Kir3 maturation and the influence of partner subunits on Kir3 lifetime and stability. Of note, we show that Kir3.1, in the absence of trafficking partner subunits, can exit the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and reach the Golgi (though not the plasma membrane), and that expression of Kir3.3 subunits drastically reduced levels of Kir3.1 in the cell. We also show that interfering with trafficking from the ER to Golgi has a pronounced inhibitory effect on Kir3.1-Kir3.2 interactions, suggesting that this complex is stabilized either en route to the Golgi or in the Golgi itself. Finally, we showed that the Kir3 channel can reach the cell surface as early as 6h post-induction and that removal of cell surface-localized channel occurs within 48h.

Previously we demonstrated that CGRP can promote proliferation and migration of endothelial cells, relating to the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Methods : CGRP1 receptor expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was examined by immunofluorescence microscopy and real-time PCR. Tube formation was measured by a Matrigel tube formation assay. VEGF protein and mRNA levels were quantified by ELISA and real-time PCR, respectively. The expression of VEGF receptor 1 (FLT1) and VEGF receptor 2 (KDR) were measured by real-time PCR and immunoblotting assays. Results : CGRP significantly induced vascular tube formation of outgrowth HUVECs in a Matrigel. The expression of FLT and KDR were significantly increased by CGRP, and CGRP enhanced the expression of CGRP1 receptors. Compared to the known angiogenesis regulator VEGF 165 , CGRP had an equal or stronger effect on migration and tube formation, but not on proliferation of endothelial cells. The upregulation of calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR), FAK, VEGF and its two main receptors (FLT1, KDR) by CGRP was also more pronounced than that obtained by VEGF 165 .

A cross-omics data analysis is useful for predicting downstream signaling pathways, and the anxiolytic-like behavior of RLX3 may be mediated by an oxytocin signaling pathway in rats.

This study examined the effect of clotrimazole on cytosolic Ca 2 concentrations ([Ca 2 ] i ) and viability in HA59T human hepatoma cells. The Ca 2 -sensitive fluorescent dye fura-2 was applied to measure [Ca 2 ] i . Clotrimazole induced [Ca 2 ] i rises in a concentration-dependent manner. The response was reduced by removing extracellular Ca 2 . Clotrimazole-evoked Ca 2 entry was suppressed by store-operated channel inhibitors (nifedipine, econazole and SK&amp;F96365) and protein kinase C modulators (GF109203X and phorbol, 12-myristate, 13-acetate). In Ca 2 -free medium, incubation with the endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 pump inhibitor 2,5-di-tert-butylhydroquinone abolished clotrimazole-induced [Ca 2 ] i rise. Inhibition of phospholipase C with U73122 abolished clotrimazole-induced [Ca 2 ] i rise. At 1040M, clotrimazole inhibited cell viability, which was not reversed by chelating cytosolic Ca 2 . Clotrimazole at 10 and 30M also induced apoptosis. Collectively, in HA59T cells, clotrimazole-induced [Ca 2 ] i rises by evoking phospholipase C-dependent Ca 2 release from the endoplasmic reticulum and Ca 2 entry via store-operated Ca 2 channels.

While only a few fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) sensors have been made for real-time detection of GPCR activation, the human genome encodes roughly 950 GPCRs and a need for a broad real-time detection system is needed. In this study, we developed and characterized a new type of G protein sensor based on the G subunit containing an intra-molecular FRET pair to allow detection of real-time G protein activation in multiple cell lines using time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. Our G sensors were able to detect G protein activation to aluminum fluoride, a G protein activator, in human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK293). Moreover, our sensors were able to couple to the bradykinin B 2 , parathyroid type 1 and adrenergic 2A GPCRs and detect G protein activation in response to the cognate ligands; bradykinin, parathyroid and noradrenaline hormones, respectively. Furthermore, our sensors also detected ligand-independent G protein activation by fluid shear stress. G protein inhibitors, pertussis toxin and guanosine 5 [-thio] diphosphate, inhibited the FRET response to G protein stimulants indicating that the sensor response is specific to G protein activation. These findings suggest that the described G sensors can be used to monitor real-time G protein activation by a variety of G protein stimulants or inhibitors.",

The expression and activity of ER- is regulated by multiple mechanisms at the transcriptional and post-translational level. Interaction of tyrosine kinase receptor-activated signaling pathways with ER- function has been reported. We previously performed a kinome-wide small interfering RNA high-throughput screen to identify novel protein kinases involved in the regulation of ER- transcriptional activity in human breast cancer cells. Our screening analysis identified the Eph receptor tyrosine kinases (Eph) as potential positive regulators of ER-. Results : In this study, we demonstrate Eph receptor B4 (EphB4), a member of Eph kinase family, a positive regulator of ER- in human breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, T-47D and BT-474). Down-regulation of EphB4 by RNA interference technology impairs estrogen-dependent ER- transcriptional activity in breast cancer cells. Decreased activity of ER- after EphB4 knockdown is the consequence of diminished ER- messenger RNA and protein expression. Furthermore, phosphorylation of Akt, a downstream mediator of EphB4, is reduced following EphB4 silencing. Conclusions : Our data suggests EphB4 as an upstream regulator of ER- in human breast cancer cells by modulating ER- transcription. The results also suggest Akt as a relevant downstream signaling molecule in this novel EphB4-ER- pathway.",

Previously, we found a novel mutation of the SOS1 gene (T158A) in a patient with Costello/CFC overlapping phenotype. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate how this mutation affects RAS/MAPK as well as PI3K/AKT pathway signal transduction. </p> <p> Materials and methods: Wild-type and mutant (T158A) Son of Sevenless 1 (SOS1) were transfected into 293T cells. The levels of phospho- and total ERK1/2, AKT, p70S6K and pS6 were examined under epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation. Results: After EGF stimulation, the ratio of phospho-ERK1/2 to total ERK1/2 was highest at 5min in mutant (T158A) SOS1 cells, and at 15min in wild-type SOS1 cells. Phospho-AKT was less abundant at 60min in mutant than in wild-type SOS1 cells. Phosphorylation at various sites in p70S6K differed between wild-type and mutant cells. Eighteen hours after activation by EGF, the ratio of phospho-ERK1/2 to total ERK1/2 remained significantly higher in mutant than in wild-type SOS1 cells, but that of phospho-AKT to total AKT was unchanged. Discussion: T158A is located in the histone-like domain, which may have a role in auto-inhibition of RAS exchanger activity of SOS1. T158A may disrupt auto-inhibition and enhance RAS signaling. T158A also affects PI3K/AKT signaling, probably via negative feedback via phospho-p70S6K.

They do not only assemble with identical receptors as homodimers, but also associate with different GPCRs to form heterodimers. We discuss here how heterodimeric GPCRs can assemble, traffic and signal in a manner distinct from their individual receptor components or from homodimers. These receptor pairs are also demonstrated to be regulated by different chaperones, Rabs and scaffolding proteins, further emphasizing their potential as unique targets. We believe in the importance of investigating each GPCR heterodimer as an individual signaling complex, as they appear to act differently from each monomer constituting them.

Previous studies have shown that beta-arrestin2 deletion enhances the efficacy of specific cannabinoid agonists. Objective : The present study hypothesized that brain cannabinoid CB 1 receptors are regulated by beta-arrestin2. Methods : Beta-arrestin2/ and / mice were used. Western blotting was used to determine the relative levels of each beta-arrestin subtype in mouse brain. Receptor binding was measured to determine whether deletion of beta-arrestin2 influences agonist binding to brain CB 1 receptors, or the subcellular localization of CB 1 in brain membranes subjected to differential centrifugation. A variety of cannabinoid agonists from different chemical classes were investigated for their ability to activate G-proteins in the presence and absence of beta-arrestin2 in cerebellum, hippocampus and cortex. Results : No differences were found in the density of beta-arrestin1 or cannabinoid CB 1 receptors in several brains of beta-arrestin2/ versus / mice. Differences between genotypes were found in the proportion of high- and low-affinity agonist binding sites in brain areas that naturally express higher levels of beta-arrestin2. Cortex from beta-arrestin2/ mice contained less CB 1 in the P1 fraction and more CB 1 in the P2 fraction compared to beta-arrestin2/.

Therefore, accurate interface prediction would accelerate investigations of the molecular mechanisms of oligomerization and signaling via GPCRs. However, interface prediction for GPCR oligomerization is difficult, because the various GPCR subtypes often use different structural regions as their interfaces, even when the subtypes belong to the same subfamily.

However, little is known as to how the pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAECs) are related to the 15-HETE-induced vasoconstriction and that which intracellular signaling systems are critical. To test this hypothesis, we examined PAs constriction in isolated rat PAs rings, the expression and activity of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) with western blot, and nitric oxide (NO) production using the DAF-FM DA fluorescent indicator. The results showed that the 15-HETE-induced PAs constriction was diminished in endothelium-intact rings. In the presence of the eNOS inhibitor L-NAME, vasoconstrictor responses to KCl were greater than the control. The activation of eNOS was activated by Ca 2 released from intracellular stores and the PI3K/Akt pathway. Phosphorylations of the eNOS at Ser-1177 and Akt at Ser-473 were necessary for their activity. A prolonged 15-HETE treatment (30min) led to a decrease in NO production by phosphorylation of eNOS at Thr-495, leading to augmentation of PAs constriction.

Recent evidence shows that insulin like growth factor 1/phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (IGF-1/PI3K/Akt) signaling is not the main pathway towards load-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy. During load-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy process, activation of mTORC1 does not require classical growth factor signaling. One potential mechanism that would activate mTORC1 is increased synthesis of phosphatidic acid (PA). Despite the huge progress in this field, it is still early to affirm which molecular event induces hypertrophy in response to mechanical overload. Until now, it seems that mTORC1 is the key regulator of load-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy. On the other hand, how mTORC1 is activated by PA is unclear, and therefore these mechanisms have to be determined in the following years. The understanding of these molecular events may result in promising therapies for the treatment of muscle-wasting diseases. For now, the best approach is a good regime of resistance exercise training.

Understanding the structurefunction relationships of these proteins is important, therefore, for GPCR-based drug discovery. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae tridecapeptide pheromone -factor receptor Ste2p has been studied as a model to explore the structurefunction relationships of this important class of cell surface receptors. Although transmembrane domains of GPCRs have been examined extensively, the extracellular N-terminus and loop regions have received less attention. We have used substituted cysteine accessibility method to probe the solvent accessibility of single cysteine residues engineered to replace residues Gly20 through Gly33 of the N-terminus of Ste2p. Unexpectedly, our analyses revealed that the residues Ser22, Ile24, Tyr26, and Ser28 in the N-terminus were solvent inaccessible, whereas all other residues of the targeted region were solvent accessible. The periodicity of accessibility from residues Ser22Ser28 is indicative of an underlying structure consistent with a -strand that was predicted computationally in this region. Moreover, a number of these Cys-substituted Ste2p receptors (G20C, S22C, I24C, Y26C, S28C and Y30C) were found to form increased dimers compared to the Cys-less Ste2p. Based on these data, we propose that part of the N-terminus of Ste2p is structured and that this structure forms a dimer interface for Ste2p molecules. Dimerization mediated by the N-terminus was affected by ligand binding, indicating an unanticipated conformational change in the N-terminus upon receptor activation.",

The pigment cells were incubated in the agonist and the antagonists within a limited time frame and subsequently their Melanophore Size Index (MSI) were calculated. The inferences were drafted through the observed signal transduction upshots in pigment translocations within the melanophores. Saccharin, in a wide dose range, has consistently induced a concentration-related aggregation similar to the aggregatory effect as shown by melatonin on the melanophores. Binding of saccharin with the receptors and eliciting its aggregatory effect is partially dependent on the release of neurotransmitters. The aggregatory effects were found to be significantly blocked by luzindole, K185, and prazosin, which are the potent melatonin receptor blockers, at the higher concentrations of saccharin. Hence, all the three subtypes of melatonin receptors viz. MT 1 , MT 2 , and MT 3 are participating in saccharin-mediated aggregations.

A first condition to have integration is obviously the presence of efficient communication processes among the parts that have to be combined into the harmonious whole. In this respect, two types of communication processes, called wiring transmission (WT) and volume transmission (VT), respectively, were found to play a major role in the nervous system, allowing the exchange of signals not only between neurons, but rather among all cell types present in the central nervous system (CNS). A second fundamental aspect of a communication process is obviously the recognition/decoding process at target level. As far as this point is concerned, increasing evidence emphasizes the importance of supramolecular complexes of receptors (the so called receptor mosaics) generated by direct receptorreceptor interactions. Their assemblage would allow a first integration of the incoming information already at the plasma membrane level. Recently, evidence of two new subtypes of WT and VT has been obtained, namely the tunnelling nanotubes mediated WT and the microvesicle (in particular exosomes) mediated VT allowing the horizontal transfer of bioactive molecules, including receptors, RNAs and micro-RNAs. The physiological and pathological implications of these types of communication have opened up a new field that is largely still unexplored. In fact, likely unsuspected integrative actions of the nervous system could occur. In this context, a holistic approach to the brain-body complex as an indissoluble system has been proposed. Thus, the hypothesis has been introduced on the existence of a brain-body integrative structure formed by the area postrema/nucleus tractus solitarius (AP/NTS) and the anteroventral third ventricle region/basal hypothalamus with the median eminence (AV3V-BH).

Through additional optimization steps, we developed a stable and flexible BRET2 assay for monitoring the interactions between the IR and its substrates. Furthermore, the insulin analogue X10 was characterized in the BRET2 assay and was found to be 10 times more potent with respect to IRS1, IRS4 and Shc recruitment compared to human insulin. This study demonstrates that the BRET2 technique can be applied to study IR signaling pathways, and that this assay can be used as a platform for screening and characterization of IR ligands.",

While other G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) can couple to STAT3, these mechanisms demonstrate coupling through SRC, TYK, Rac, or complex formation with Gq and used only transfected cell lines. Using normal and transgenic mice containing constitutively active mutations (CAM) of the 1A -AR subtype, neonatal mouse myocytes and whole hearts were analyzed for the mechanism to couple to STAT3 activation. 1 -ARs stimulated time-dependent increases in p-SRC, p-JAK2, and p-STAT3 in normal neonatal myocytes. Using various kinase inhibitors and siRNA, we determined that the 1A -AR coupled to STAT3 through distinct and unique pathways in neonatal myocytes. We found that PKC inhibition decreased p-ERK and p-Ser STAT3 levels without affecting p-Tyr STAT3. In contrast, we found that PKC inhibition affected p-SRC and p-JAK2 resulting in decreased p-Tyr and p-Ser STAT3 levels. We suggest a novel 1A -AR mediated PKC/ERK pathway that regulates the phosphorylation status of STAT3 at Ser-727 while PKC couples to SRC/JAK2 to affect Tyr-705 phosphorylation. Furthermore, this pathway has not been previously described in a GPCR system that couples to STAT3. Given cell survival and protective cardiac effects induced by PKC, STAT3 and ERK signaling, our results could explain the neuroprotective and cardiac protective pathways that are enhanced with 1A -AR agonism.",

The Ca 2+ -sensitive fluorescent dye fura-2 was applied to measure [Ca 2+ ] i . Diindolylmethane at concentrations of 2050 M induced [Ca 2+ ] i rise in a concentration-dependent manner. The response was reduced partly by removing Ca 2+ . Diindolylmethane-evoked Ca 2+ entry was suppressed by nifedipine, econazole, SK&amp;F96365, protein kinase C modulators and aristolochic acid.

Acyl nitroso bears structural and electrochemical similarity to the phenylhydroxylamine-nitrosobenzene couple and to -dicarbonyls. Acyl nitroso may be involved in electron transfer, reactive oxygen species formation and oxidative stress. Cell signaling plays a significant role in the biological action. The therapeutic properties are discussed with suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid attracting the most attention as an anticancer agent. Promise as a practical medicine for treatment of cancer is indicated by clinical trials. Toxicity is also included. Acyl nitroso, HNO, nitric oxide, and metal complexes of the parent drug are designated the main actors in the physiological effects.",

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 2 and 4 and members of its signaling pathway, including myeloid differentiation primary response protein (MyD88), MyD88 adapter-like protein (MAL) and suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1), are involved in this inflammatory response. A number of studies have suggested a possible role for MAL in developing CM and that modulating the behavior of MAL may prevent such complications. Mutagenesis studies have suggested that MAL becomes active after phosphorylation of tyrosines and the computational studies presented here characterize the possible roles of two tyrosinesTyr86 and Tyr106in MAL activity. The effects of phosphorylation on the structure of MAL and on its binding with two binding partners MyD88 and SOCS1 are studied here. The results suggest that phosphorylation of Tyr86 leads to conformational changes in the BB loop of MAL, and this conformational switch forms the interface for binding with MyD88. Similarly, our results suggest that phosphorylation of Tyr106 contributes to the stability of MAL-MyD88 dimer formation, and may form a possible binding site for SOCS1. Thus, our study supports roles for tyrosines 86 and 106 in signaling pathways involving MAL, and hence as potential drug targets against hyperinflammatory response to infection by Plasmodium falciparum and vivax .",

It is still unknown, however, whether 15-HETE acts on the apoptotic responses through the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) pathway. The aim of the study is to test the hypothesis that ERK1/2 pathway participates in the protective effects of 15-HETE on the cell survival. This hypothesis was validated by cell viability measurement, nuclear morphology determination, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay, mitochondrial potentials assay and Western blot. We found that 15-HETE enhanced cell survival, suppressed the expression of phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten, upregulated X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein and Bcl-2 and attenuated mitochondrial depolarization in pulmonary artery muscle smooth cells (PASMCs) under serum-deprived conditions. These effects were reversed by ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059.

Here, we further discussed the potential mechanism of ischemic brain injury induced by the activation of JNK after 15min of transient global cerebral ischemia. As a result, through inhibiting phosphorylation of Bcl-2 (a cytosolic target of JNK) and 14-3-3 protein (a cytoplasmic anchor of Bax) induced by the activation of JNK, K252a decreased the release of Bax from Bcl-2/Bax and 14-3-3/Bax dimers, further attenuating the translocation of Bax from cytosol to mitochondria and the release of cytochrome c induced by ischemia/reperfusion, which related to mitochondria-mediated apoptosis.

Male BrownNorway rats were dosed (8mg/kg, intratracheal) 24h prior to testing with particles containing the EPFR of 1, 2-dichlorobenzene (DCB230). DCB230 treatment decreased systolic and diastolic function. DCB230 also produced pulmonary and cardiac inflammation. After ischemia, systolic, but not diastolic function was significantly decreased in DCB230-treated rats. Ventricular function was not affected by I/R in control rats. There was greater oxidative stress in the heart and increased 8-isoprostane (biomarker of oxidative stress) in the plasma of treated vs. control rats after I/R. These data demonstrate for the first time that DCB230 can produce inflammation and significantly decrease cardiac function at baseline and after I/R in vivo . Furthermore, these data suggest that EPFRs may be a risk factor for cardiac toxicity in healthy individuals and individuals with ischemic heart disease. Potential mechanisms involving cytokines/chemokines and/or oxidative stress are discussed.",

In the present study, we show functional expression of TRPA1 in human lung fibroblast cells (CCD19-Lu) and human pulmonary alveolar epithelial cell line (A549). We demonstrate TRPA1 expression at both mRNA and protein levels in these cell types. TRPA1 selective agonists like allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), crotonaldehyde and zinc, induced a concentration-dependent increase in Ca 2 influx in CCD19-Lu and A549 cells. AITC-induced Ca 2 influx was inhibited by Ruthenium red (RR), a TRP channel pore blocker, and by GRC 17536, a TRPA1 specific antagonist. Furthermore, we also provide evidence that activation of the TRPA1 receptor by TRPA1 selective agonists promotes release of the chemokine IL-8 in CCD19-Lu and A549 cells. The IL-8 release in response to TRPA1 agonists was attenuated by TRPA1 selective antagonists.

We have demonstrated that Octreotide inhibits only LPS induced secretion of proinflammatory cytokines including TNFa by Kupffer cells (KC). We, therefore, tested the hypothesis that somatostatin modulates the expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) receptors and apoptosis of KC. </p> <p> Methods : Rat KC were isolated by centrifugal elutriation. TNFR1 and TNFR2 expression was studied by RT-PCR, quantitative PCR, Western Blot and immunofluorescence before and after Octreotide pre-incubation. Apoptosis was assessed by quantitative measurement of cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments. TNFa mRNA expression was assessed by semiquantitative PCR and TNFa was measured in cell supernatants by ELISA.</p> <p> Results : TNFR1 and TNFR2 mRNA are constitutively expressed in KC. Octreotide incubation increased both receptors expression with a peak at 6h and return to basal levels at 24h. TNFR1 was mostly influenced. However, only increase in TNFR2 protein was identified, whereas a band at 90 kD was present instead of a band at 55 kD as expected for TNFR1. TNF mRNA expression was inhibited by Octreotide and a significant inhibition was observed at 48h. TNF had no effect on KC apoptosis, whereas Octreotide significantly increased their apoptosis, and this effect was not influenced by co-incubation with TNFa.</p> <p> Conclusion : TNFR1 and TNFR2 are constitutively expressed in KC and their expression is strongly increased by somatostatin. Moreover, somatostatin increases KC apoptosis. These findings may in part explain the antineoplasmatic effect of somatostatin.",

This work attempted to address this question and to unravel the signaling pathway involved using Caco-2 cells as a model. After an overnight starvation, cells were treated with insulin in presence and absence of specific inhibitors of some known mediators. The activity of the pump was assayed by measuring the ouabain-inhibitable inorganic phosphate (P i ) released, whereas changes in its abundance were determined by western blot analysis. Insulin decreased the activity and abundance of the ATPase in a crude membrane homogenate. This effect disappeared completely upon inhibition of either phosphotidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) or protein kinase C (PKC), but was partially abolished when p38MAPK or MEK/ERK were inhibited separately. Activation of PKC with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) imitated the effect of insulin and was not affected by inhibition of PI3K. The data suggest that PI3K and PKC are along the same pathway that branches into two separate ones involving each either p38MAP kinase or MEK/ERK. This hypothesis was confirmed by the data obtained from the treatment of Caco-2 cells with PMA, when p38MAPK and MEK/ERK were inhibited simultaneously.

We showed that carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4 )-induced liver injury up-regulated HNF1, whereas the expression of HNF6 was not affected by the chemical stress, indicating unknown physiological roles of HNF1 against the chemical stress, not in cooperation with HNF6. To determine whether HNF1 has a novel function in the liver regeneration, we overexpressed HNF1 in the mouse liver by adenoviral gene delivery. We revealed that overexpression of HNF1 resulted in accelerated cell proliferation with the protein level up-regulation of plasminogen and plasmin, a converted active form of plasminogen, which play a pivotal role in liver regeneration inducing hepatocyte proliferation. Despite this stimulatory effect for the liver regeneration, HNF1 overexpression significantly increased genomic instability with decreased protein level of mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1 (MDC1) and dephosphorylation of SP1 transcription factor. The increased expression of HNF1 is associated with several types of hepatocyte carcinomas, indicating possible involvement of the factor in carcinogenesis.

The entries in the database are divided into two sections: (I) Experiment Information section and (II) Prediction Information section. The Experiment Information section contains (I-i) experimentally indentified GPCR oligomers and their annotations, and (I-ii) experimentally suggested interfaces for the oligomerization. Since the number of experimentally suggested interfaces is limited, the entries in the Prediction Information section have been introduced to provide information about the oligomerization interfaces predicted by our computational method. The experimentally suggested or computationally predicted interfaces are displayed by 3D graphics, using GPCRs with available coordinates. The information in the GRIPDB, especially that about the interfaces, is useful to investigate the molecular mechanisms of signal transduction via GPCR oligomerization. The GRIPDB is available on the web at the following URL: http://grip.cbrc.jp/GDB/index.html .",

Herein, we propose new putative targets for drug development based on recent data on GPCR allosterism and on the existence of receptor mosaics (RMs). The main target for drug development is still GPCRs, but the focus is not the orthosteric binding pocket. According to the mosaic model of the plasma membrane, we mainly discuss the possibility of indirect modulatory pharmacological actions on expression/function of GPCRs. In particular, the following two new targets will be analyzed: a) The possibility of pharmacological interventions on the roamer-type of volume transmission (VT), which allow the intercellular transfer of set of signal molecules such as GPCRs, tetraspanins and ribonucleic acids. Thus, there is the possibility of pharmacological interventions on the decoding capabilities of neurons and/or glial cells by means of an action on composition and release of micro-vesicles. b) The possibility of pharmacological interventions on epigenetic mechanisms by taking into account their inter-relationships with GPCRs. As a matter of fact, there are epigenetic changes that are characteristic of periods of developmental plasticity that could provide a target for therapeutic intervention in the event of brain damage. We believe that almost all the biochemical knowledge presently available on GPCRs can be used in the development of these new pharmacological approaches.",

Carvedilol at concentrations between 10 and 40 M increased [Ca 2 ] i in a concentration-dependent fashion. The Ca 2 signal was decreased by 50% by removing extracellular Ca 2 . Carvedilol-induced Ca 2 entry was not affected by the store-operated Ca 2 channel blockers nifedipine, econazole, and SK&amp;F96365, but was enhanced by activation or inhibition of protein kinase C. In Ca 2 -free medium, incubation with the endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 pump inhibitor thapsigargin did not change carvedilol-induced [Ca 2 ] i rise; conversely, incubation with carvedilol did not reduce thapsigargin-induced Ca 2 release. Pretreatment with the mitochondrial uncoupler carbonylcyanide m -chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) inhibited carvedilol-induced [Ca 2 ] i release. Inhibition of phospholipase C with U73122 did not alter carvedilol-induced [Ca 2 ] i rise. Carvedilol at 550 M induced cell death in a concentration-dependent manner.

In this study, the models of the human bitter taste receptor hTAS2R1 alone and in complex with various ligands were constructed on the basis of template-based modeling and molecular docking. Then these models were subjected to all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in explicit lipid bilayers. The binding pocket of hTAS2R1 is mainly formed by transmembrane helix (TM) III, TM V, TM VI, and TM VII. Most of the residues contributing to ligand binding are positionally conserved comparing with other hTAS2Rs. By comparing the final conformations obtained by extensive MD simulations, we identified the changes in the transmembrane helices and the intra- and extracellular loops, which were expected to initiate the activation of the receptor. The intracellular loop II (ICL2) and TM III were found to play prominent roles in the process of activation. We proposed that a set of interactions between the aromatic Phe115 in the middle of ICL2 and three residues (Tyr103, Lys106, and Val107) at the cytoplasmic end of TM III may serve as a conformational switch of hTAS2R1 activation. All of the residues involved in the switch are highly conserved among T2Rs. This indicates that the control switch we proposed may be universal in T2Rs. Besides, our results also suggest that the formation of a short helical segment in ICL2 may be necessary for the activation of hTAS2R1.",

The vital signs of control rats were lost within an average of 23min after bleeding. Intravenous administration of taltirelin (0.030.3mg/kg) and TRH (1 and 3mg/kg) immediately after bleeding accelerated recovery of MAP and RR, and prolonged viable time in a dose-dependent manner. The potency of taltirelin in accelerating MAP and RR recovery and prolonging viable time was higher when compared with that of TRH. In addition, recovery of MAP and RR and the extension of viable time by taltirelin were inhibited by preintraperitoneal administration of atropine sulfate, which is a centrally acting muscarinic antagonist, but not by that of atropine methylbromide, which is a peripherally acting muscarinic antagonist. Taltirelin also recovered decreased arterial pH, bicarbonate ions, and base excess, and prevented a decrease in arterial oxygen saturation. In conclusion, the anti-shock effect of taltirelin was more potent than that of TRH. Taltirelin activity was mediated by the central muscarinic cholinergic system. In addition, taltirelin also corrected metabolic acidosis. These results suggest that taltirelin could be useful in the treatment of hypovolemic shock.",

Here we show, by performing site-directed mutagenesis studies of ectopically expressed chimeric chicken 7/mouse 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 receptor-channel complex, in combination with whole-cell current measurements, in the presence and absence of galantamine, that the APL binding site is different from the proposed PAM binding site. We demonstrate that residues T197, I196, and F198 of -strand 10 represent major elements of the galantamine binding site. Residue K123, earlier suggested as being close to the APL binding site, is not part of this site but rather appears to play a role in coupling of agonist binding to channel opening and closing. Our data confirm our earlier results that the galantamine binding site is different from the ACh binding site. Both sites are in close proximity and hence may influence each other in a synergistic fashion. Other interesting areas identified in the present study are a hinge region around and containing residues F122, K123, and K143 possibly being involved in relaying the signal of agonist binding to gating of the transmembrane channel, and a folding centre, with P119 as the dominating residue, that crucially positions the agonist binding site with respect to the hinge region.",

Cardiac-specific deletion of NMDA-R1 has been shown to ameliorate Hcy-induced myocyte contractility. Hcy activates mitochondrial matrix metalloproteinase-9 (mtMMP-9) and induces translocation of connexin-43 (Cxn-43) to the mitochondria (mtCxn-43). We sought to show cardiac-specific deletion of NMDA-R1 mitigates Hcy-induced mtCxn-43 translocation, mtMMP-9-mediated mtCxn-43 degradation, leading to mitophagy, in part, by decreasing mitochondrial permeability (MPT). Cardiac-specific knockout (KO) of NAMDA-R1 was generated using the cre/lox approach. The myocyte mitochondria were isolated from wild type (WT), WT Hcy (1.8g of DL-Hcy/L in the drinking water for 6 weeks), NMDA-R1 KO Hcy, and NR1 fl/fl /Cre (NR1 fl/fl ) genetic control mice. Mitochondrial respiratory capacity and MPT were measured by fluorescence-dye methods. The mitochondrial superoxide and peroxinitrite levels were detected by confocal microscopy using Mito-SOX and dihydrorhodamine-123.

There was a robust increase in mtMMP-9 activity. An increase in translocation and degradation of mtCxn-43 was also noted. These increases led to mitophagy. The effects were ameliorated by cardiac-specific deletion of NMDA-R1. We concluded that HHcy increased mitochondrial nitrosative stress, thereby activating mtMMP-9 and inciting the degradation of mtCxn-43. This led to mitophagy, in part, by activating NMDA-R1.

The aim of our study is to evaluate whether these pathways are implicated in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and to seek indirect evidence of a common pathogenetic pathway with lung cancer. m-RNA expression of oncogenes participating in these two signaling pathways, as well as the combined m-RNA expression of the suppressor genes R-kip and p53 in lung tissue of patients with IPF were evaluated. </p> <p> Basic procedures : The study population was composed by two distinct groups. Patients with IPF ( n 25) and control subjects who underwent thoracic surgery for reasons other than interstitial lung disease ( n 10). Expression analysis of the aforementioned oncogenes and suppressor genes was performed using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.</p> <p> Main findings : We found no difference in the overall m- RNA expression between controls and IPF in both investigated pathways. However, Braf has been overexpressed in IPF samples ( P 0.01) in contrast with K-ras that has been found downregulated ( P <0.001) in comparison with controls.</p> <p> Principal conclusions : These findings cannot exclude the hypothesis of involvement of Akt and MAPK signalling pathways in pathogenesis of IPF. However, further investigation is needed in order to verify these data.",

GPCR heteromerization, raising different combinatorial possibilities, thus underlies an unexpected level of diversity within this receptor family. </p> <p> Methods : In this paper, we summarize recent data, reported by different research groups, suggesting that the dopamine (DA) D1 receptor forms heteromers with receptors of the same family and with structurally and functionally divergent receptors.</p> <p> Results and discussion : DA D1 and D3 receptors and glutamate NMDA receptors regulate rewarding mechanisms and motivated behavior, modulate emotional and cognitive processes and regulate locomotor activity by extensive cross-talk mechanisms. Co-localization of D1 and D3 receptors and D1 and NMDA receptors in specific neuronal populations in the striatum and nucleus accumbens, moreover, suggested that their cross-talk may involve direct interactions. By using different experimental approaches various groups have, in fact, demonstrated the existence of D1-NMDA and D1-D3 heteromers, in both transfected cell systems and in the straitum, with peculiar pharmacological, signaling, and functional properties. The putative role of the D1-D3 and D1-NMDA heteromers in the physiological regulation of striatal function and in the development of motor dysfunctions will be discussed.",

Liver membranes and total RNA were prepared from young (4- to 6-month-old) and old (24-month-old) male Fischer 344 rats. AR density (B max ) in liver membranes was measured by a radioligand receptor binding assay using the receptor subtype nonselective AR antagonist 125 I-pindolol as the radioligand. Steady-state levels of 2 AR mRNA in rat liver were measured by Northern blot analysis; because of the low abundance of 1 AR and 3 AR mRNA in rat liver, the expressions of these genes were measured by a semiquantitative RT-PCR or an RT-PCR. Scatchard analysis of saturation binding curves of the binding assay confirmed an age-related increase in B max (young: 7.10.8fmol/mg protein vs. old: 18.14.3fmol/mg protein). No age-related differences were found in the levels of 2 AR mRNA. However, semiquantitative RT-PCR revealed an approximately twofold increase in 1 AR mRNA level between young and old rats ( P &lt;0.05). 1 AR mRNA levels were also correlated with B max values for 125 I-pindolol binding sites in individual rats ( r 0.67; P 0.012). 3 AR mRNA, which was demonstrable in rat white adipose tissue by RT-PCR, was generally not detected in livers from young or old rats, with the exception of two old rats with the highest B max .

ERR was the first ONR to be identified; however, its natural endogenous ligand(s) is still unknown. ERR by acting as a transcription factor has been shown to regulate a large array of genes, thereby controlling numerous metabolic pathways and other biological functions in animals. Of late, the expression of ERR has been detected in several tissues, including those with high metabolic activities and energy demand. Presently, the control of energy balance by ERR seems to be its prime role. The nonavailability of endogenous ligand for ERR has not impeded the study of its functions. In fact, most of the present knowledge of the biological roles of ERR has evolved from in-depth biochemical, overexpression, genomic, including functional genomics studies, and also through the generation of intact ERR knockout (null) mice. Interestingly, over the past few years, growing evidence suggests interplay between ERR and various human metabolic diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and heart disease. Also, there are strong indications of the involvement of ERR in cancer initiation and progression.

We also showed in transgenic mouse (TgM) that the hAGT is abundantly expressed in the kidney where the level of endogenous mouse AGT (mAGT) expression is low. To elucidate molecular mechanisms of the AGT gene activation in the kidney, we first investigated the HNF4 and AGT expression in the mouse kidney. Northern blot, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analyses revealed that the hAGT and HNF4 were both expressed in the proximal tubular (PT) cells of the kidney. We then transfected the hAGT reporter constructs into immortalized mouse PT (mProx) cells and found that regions C and J contributed additively to the HNF4-potentiated hAGT promoter activity. Curiously, no obvious HNF4 binding motif was found in the corresponding region of the mAGT promoter and co-transfected HNF4 failed to activate this promoter in neither HepG2 nor mProx cells. These results suggest that the high-level hAGT expression in the TgM kidney is, at least in part, due to a presence of high-affinity HNF4 binding sites in its promoter.",

An approximation of the virtually unknown C p temperature function enables then to determine and numerically solve temperature functions of thermodynamic parameters H and S (enthalpy and entropy change, respectively). Analytical solutions and respective numeric procedures for several such approximation formulas are suggested in the presented paper. Agreement between results obtained by this analysis with direct microcalorimetric measurements of H (and C p derived from them) was approved on selected cases of biochemical interactions presented in the literature. Analysis of several ligand-membrane receptor systems indicates that temperature profiles of H and S are parallel, largely not monotonic, and frequently attain both positive and negative values within the current temperature range of biochemical reactions. Their course is determined by the reaction change of heat capacity: temperature extremes (maximum or minimum) of both H and S occur at C p 0, for most of these systems at roughly 285305 K. Thus, the driving forces of these interactions may change from enthalpy-, entropy-, or enthalpy-entropy-driven in a narrow temperature interval.

Immunization with the EL1 peptide resulted in Abs that enhanced the effects of the endogenous ligand -melanocyte-stimulating hormone (-MSH), whereas immunization with the EL3 peptide resulted in Abs acting as non-competitive antagonists. The phenotype of immunized rats chronically instrumented with telemetry transducers was studied under four different conditions: a high-fat diet was followed by standard lab chow, by fasting, and finally by an intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Under high-fat diet, food intake and body weight were higher in the EL3 than in the EL1 or the control group. Blood pressure was increased in EL3 rats and locomotor activity was reduced. Plasma concentrations of triglycerides, insulin, and leptin tended to rise in the EL3 group. After switching to standard lab chow, the EL1 group showed a small significant increase in blood pressure that was more pronounced and associated with an increase in heart rate during food restriction. No differences between the EL1 or the EL3 group were observed after LPS injection. These results show that immunization against the MC3R resulted in the production of Abs with positive or negative allosteric properties.

The ubiquitination of NIK by cIAP1 was inhibited by the expression of TRAF2 with physical binding to cIAP1. TANK deficiency by small interfering RNA (siRNA) impaired TACI-dependent inhibition of NF-B2 p100 processing. TANK also inhibited TRAF2-mediated cIAP1 inactivation.

Our current view is that, as it seeks to fill its octahedral coordination shell, Mg acts as a keystone locking the G protein- subunits into a conformation in which G dissociates from the G dimer, is competent in regulating effectors, and acquires GTPase activity. The latter is the result of moving the backbone carbonyl group of the Mg-coordinating threonine into a location in space that positions the hydrolytic water so as to facilitate the waters nucleophilic attack that leads to hydrolysis of the link between the and phosphates of guanosine triphosphate (GTP).

We derived a kinetic rate equation based on the dissociation rate constant for an unlabeled compound competing for the same site as a labeled compound and describe a model to simulate fractional occupancy. To validate our model, we performed in vitro kinetics and ex vivo occupancy experiments in rat cortex with varying concentrations of (R)-dimethindene, a sedating antihistamine. Brain tissue was removed at various times post oral administration, and histamine H1 receptor ligand [ 3 H]-doxepin binding to homogenates from drug-treated or vehicle-treated rats was measured at multiple time points at room temperature. Fractional occupancy and k 4 for (R)-dimethindene binding to H1 receptors were calculated by using our proposed model. Rats dosed with 30 and 60mg/kg (R)-dimethindene showed 42% and 67% occupancy of central H1 receptors, respectively. These results were comparable to occupancy data determined by equilibrium radioligand binding. In addition, drug k 4 rate determined by using our ex vivo method was equivalent to k 4 determined by in vitro competition kinetics (dissociation half-life t 1/2 ~ 30min). The outlined method can be used to assess, by simulation and experiment, occupancy for compounds based on dissociation rate constants and contributes to current efforts in drug optimization to profile antagonist efficacy in terms of its kinetic drug-target binding parameters.

Smad2 mRNA level in the group at dose of 4.2mg/kg/day AAI increased 106.4%, and declined 12% in the group at dose of 12mg/kg/day AAI; Smad4 expression was down-regulated in experimental groups, which declined 13% in the group at dose of 4.2mg/kg/day AAI. Smad7 mRNA level was down-regulated by AAI in dose-dependence. Collectively, the involvement in interstitial fibrosis progression of active TGF- is highly suggested, via the Smads intracellular signaling pathway.

There is considerable data to indicate that these are real phenomena that may be exploited for therapeutic advantage. A therapeutically relevant example will be discussed from a recent program designed to block entry of HIV-1 for the prevention and therapy of AIDS. The allosteric modulator aplaviroc (873140) and other allosteric modulators will be highlighted with reference to the development of future drugs that block the involvement of receptors in pathological process but otherwise allow them to function normally.

NOP or orphanin FQ) receptors mediates analgesia through inhibition of N-type calcium channels in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons ( 1 , 2 ). Unlike the three types of classical , , and opioid receptors, ORL1 mediates an agonist-independent inhibition of N-type calcium channels. This is mediated via the formation of a physical protein complex between the receptor and the channel, which in turn allows the channel to effectively sense a low level of constitutive receptor activity ( 3 ). Further inhibition of N-type channel activity by activation of other G protein-coupled receptors is thus precluded. ORL1 receptors, however, also undergo agonist-induced internalization into lysosomes, and channels thereby become cointernalized in a complex with ORL1. This then results in removal of N-type channels from the plasma membrane and reduced calcium entry ( 4 ). Similar signaling complexes between N-type channels and GABA B receptors have been reported ( 5 ). Moreover, both L-type and P/Q-type channels appear to be able to associate with certain types of G protein-coupled receptors ( 6 , 7 ). Hence, interactions between receptors and voltage-gated calcium channels may be a widely applicable means to optimize receptor channel coupling.",

Recent studies suggest a crucial role for the different PARs in innate immune response. The role of PARs in the activation of pain pathways appears to be dual. Subinflammatory doses of PAR 2 agonists induce hyperalgesia and allodynia, and PAR 2 activation has been implicated in the generation of inflammatory hyperalgesia. In contrast, subinflammatory doses of PAR 1 or PAR 4 increase nociceptive threshold, inhibiting inflammatory hyperalgesia, thereby acting as analgesic mediators.

Finally, concentration-effect curves for the allosteric delay of W84 on [ 3 H]-NMS dissociation right shifted from an IC 50 of 33 nmol/L to 78 nmol/L, 992 nmol/L, and 1670 nmol/L in the presence of 6.7 10 8 , 1.33 10 7 , and 2.0 10 7 mol/L of anti-el2 affinity-purified CChP-IgGs.

By using mouse primary renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs) cultured in vitro and combining with two AAI treatment types (dose-response studies and time-response studies), we sought to investigate the nephrotoxicity of AAI further. Following our molecular and pharmacological studies, we found that high doses of AAI could lead to the death of RTECs within a short time, but low doses in a long duration only induce the epithelial cells to transform into myofibroblasts (MFs). This was also immediately identified by the increased expression of vimentin and de novo expression of -smooth muscle actin ( -SMA) with the loss of cytokeratin 18 (CK18) by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) and immunofluorescence staining. The transcriptional level of transforming growth factor- 1 (TGF- 1) in the group treated with AAI significantly increased twice as much as the control. Smad2 mRNA level in the group with 50 ng/mL AAI declined by 23.4 at 24 hr, then increased by 180.0 at 36 hr; it was also evidently increased (217.4) after being treated with 30 ng/mL AAI for 24 hr. Meanwhile, Smad7 mRNA level was down-regulated by AAI in dose- and time-dependence. Furthermore, by cotransfecting in mouse primary RTECs, the transcriptional level of Smad7 promoter-luciferase reporter gene was significantly down-regulated by AAI (300 ng/mL), and the expression of myofibroblast-specific markers induced by AAI was also suppressed by the specific antagonist of TGF- 1 receptors (SB-431542). Collectively, the present results suggest that AAI may induce cytotoxicity through its conductive epithelial to mesenchymal transition, and TGF-1/Smad7 signaling can stimulate renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis induced by AAI.",

Because arrestin-bound GPCRs are uncoupled from G proteins, arrestin binding can be viewed as switching receptors between two temporally and spatially distinct signaling modes. Recent work has established two factors that underscore this duality of GPCR signaling and suggest it may ultimately have therapeutic significance. The first is that signaling by receptor-arrestin signalsomes does not require heterotrimeric G protein activation. The second is that arrestin-dependent signals can be initiated by pathway-specific biased agonists, creating the potential for drugs that selectively modulate different aspects of GPCR function. Currently, however, little is known about the physiological relevance of G protein-independent signals at the cellular or whole animal levels, and additional work is needed to determine whether arrestin pathway-selective drugs will find clinical application.",

Phosphorylation of the C-terminal tail of GPCRs by GRKs triggers the docking of -arrestins and the functional uncoupling of G proteins and receptors. In addition, we and others have uncovered new direct ways by which GRKs could impinge into intracellular signalling pathways independently of receptor phosphorylation. In particular, we have characterized that elevated GRK2 levels can reduce CCR2-mediated activation of the ERK MAPK route in a manner that is independent of kinase activity and also of G proteins. This inhibition of ERK occurred in the absence of any reduction on MEK phosphorylation, what implicates that GRK2 is acting at the level of MEK or at the MEK-ERK interface to achieve a downregulation of ERK phosphorylation. In fact, we describe here that a direct association between GRK2 and MEK proteins can be detected in vitro. p38 MAPK pathway also appears to be regulated directly by GRK2 in a receptor-independent manner. p38 can be phosphorylated by GRK2 in threonine 123, a residue sitting at the entrance of a docking groove by which this MAPK associates to substrates and upstream activators. The T123phospho-mimetic mutant of p38 shows a reduced ability to bind to MKK6, concomitant with an impaired p38 activation, and a decreased phosphorylation of downstream substrates such as MEF2, MK2 and ATF2. Elevated levels of GRK2 downregulate p38-dependent cellular responses, such as differentiation of preadipocytic cells, while LPS-induced cytokine release is enhanced in macrophages from GRK2 (/) mice. In sum, we describe in this article different ways by which GRK2 directly regulates MAPK-mediated cellular events. This regulation of the MAPK modules by GRK2 could be relevant in pathological situations where the levels of this kinase are altered, such as during inflammatory diseases or cardiovascular pathologies.",

Pelvic blood flow was determined by using a fluorescent microsphere infusion technique. Expression levels of nNOS and eNOS mRNAs in the rat genitourinary tissues were quantified by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using SYBR Green I. The characteristics of 1 -adrenoceptors in the rat iliac artery were determined by using radioligand receptor binding and real-time RT-PCR techniques. Untreated SHRs had lower blood flow to the ventral prostate, dorsolateral prostate, urinary bladder, and penis and lower mRNA expression levels of nNOS in the bladder and penis and eNOS in the penis than untreated WKY rats. Naftopidil had no significant effects on blood flow and NOS levels, whereas administration of prazosin and cyclazosin to the SHR caused a significant increase in blood flow to each tissue studied and a significant increase in expression levels of these genes. The density of total 1 -adrenoceptors was significantly higher in iliac arteries of untreated SHRs than those of untreated WKY rats. RT-PCR data indicated that 1B -adrenoceptor mRNA was the significantly predominant gene transcript in iliac arteries of untreated SHRs. Our data show that prazosin, but not naftopidil, causes differential alterations in NOS levels in the SHR genitourinary tract, which could be due to increased pelvic blood flow resulting from inhibiting the vascular 1B -adrenoceptor.

Muscarinic and MAS stimulation of NPR-GC was blocked by antibodies against C-terminal of G q16 , whose expression was confirmed by RT-PCR. However, synthetic peptides from C-terminal of G q15/16 stimulated the NPR-GC. Coupling of q16 to M 3 AChR is supported by MAS decreased [ 3 H]QNB binding, being abolished after M 3 AChR-4-DAMP-alkylation. Anti-i 3 M 3 AChR antibodies blocked the muscarinic activation of NPR-GC, and synthetic peptide from i 3 M 3 AChR (M 3 P) was more potent than MAS increasing GTP [ 35 S] and decreasing the [ 3 H]QNB activities.

Previous studies have used RNA localization or low-avidity antibodies in tissue or cell lines to determine the 1 -AR subtype and suggested that the 1 A -AR is dominant. Two androgen-insensitive, human metastatic cancer cell lines DU145 and PC3 were used as well as the mouse TRAMP C1-C3 primary and clonal cell lines. The density of 1 -ARs was determined by saturation binding and the distribution of the different 1 -AR subtypes was examined by competition-binding experiments. In contrast to previous studies, the major 1 -AR subtype in DU145, PC3 and all of the TRAMP cell lines is the 1B -AR. DU145 cells contained 100 of the 1B -AR subtype, whereas PC3 cells were composed of 21 1 A -AR and 79 1B -AR. TRAMP cell lines contained between 66 and 79 of the 1B -AR with minor fractions of the other two subtypes. Faster doubling time in the TRAMP cell lines correlated with decreasing 1B -AR and increasing 1 A - and 1D -AR densities. Transfection with EGFP-tagged 1B -ARs revealed that localization was mainly intracellular, but the majority of the receptors translocated to the cell surface after extended preincubation (18 hr) with either agonist or antagonist. Localization was confirmed by ligand-binding studies and inositol phosphate assays where prolonged preincubation with either agonist and/or antagonist increased the density and function of 1 -ARs, suggesting that the native receptors were mostly intracellular and nonfunctional. Our studies indicate that 1B -ARs are the major 1 -AR subtype expressed in DU145, PC3, and all TRAMP cell lines, but most of the receptor is localized in intracellular compartments in a nonfunctional state, which can be rescued upon prolonged incubation with any ligand.",

As such, the use of drugs in combination are particularly effective interventions in networked systems. However, common synergy measures are often inadequate to quantify the effect of two different drugs in complex cellular systems. This article proposes a general approach to quantifying the synergy of two drugs in combination. This approach is called strong nonlinear blending . Drugs with different relative potencies, different effect maxima, or situations of potentiation or coalism pose no problem for strong nonlinear blending as a way to assess the increased response benefit to be gained by combining two drugs. This is important as testing drug combinations in complex biological systems are likely to produce a wide variety of possible response surfaces. It is also shown that for monotone increasing (or decreasing) dose response surfaces that strong nonlinear blending is equivalent to improved potency along a ray of constant dose ratio. This is important because fixed dose ratios form the basis for many preclinical and clinical combination drug experiments.

In vitro, all three peptides were more potent ligands of the mouse B16-F1 melanoma cell melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1-R) than DOTA-NAPamide, which served as standard. The binding activity of DOTA-diHexa(NC-NC)-amide was 1.75-fold higher, that of diHexa(NC-NC)-Gly-Lys(DOTA)-amide was 3.37-fold higher, and that of DOTA-diHexa(CN-NC)-amide was 2.34-fold higher.

We used molecular docking simulations to find that phenylthiocarbamide exhibited a higher affinity for the target receptor than the structurally similar molecule 6-n-propylthiouracil, in line with recent experimental studies. A 3D model was constructed for the hTAS2R16 bitter taste receptor as well, by applying the same protocol.

The analysis provides insights into diffusion-limited analyte-receptor reactions occurring on heterogeneous biosensor surfaces. Numerical values obtained for the binding and the dissociation rate coefficients are linked to the degree of heterogeneity or roughness [fractal dimension (D(f))] present on the biosensor chip surface. The binding and dissociation rate coefficients are sensitive to the degree of heterogeneity on the surface. For example, for the binding of plasma insulin, as the fractal dimension value increases by a factor of 2.47 from D(f1)=0.6827 to D(f2)=1.6852, the binding rate coefficient increases by a factor of 4.92 from k(1)=1.0232 to k(2)=5.0388. An increase in the degree of heterogeneity on the probe surface leads to an increase in the binding rate coefficient. A dual-fractal analysis is required to fit the binding kinetics in most of the cases presented. A single fractal analysis is adequate to describe the dissociation kinetics. Affinity (ratio of the binding to the dissociation rate coefficient) values are also presented.

In this article, we apply the service-theoretic approach to receptor-agonist systems and show how by changing the stochastic time pattern of operationally relevant point events (e.g., instants of agonist arrival, instants of postclimax agonist departure) a great variety of dose-response curves may be generated, even in very simple reaction schemes, which, according to mass action kinetics, invariably lead to hyperbolic r ( A ) curves ( r and A stand for response and agonist concentration, respectively). The molecular timing inherent to a hyperbolic response system is not optimal: for instance, at the agonist concentration A 50 , half of the agonist molecules are rejected (lost) because of unfortunate timing of the arrival events. The fraction of lost arrivers can be diminished considerably if the arrivals are better timed: sub-Poisson arrivals improve the timing and, thus, convert hyperbolic r ( A ) curves into lifted nonhyperbolic ones. Conversely, super-Poisson arrivals make the nonoptimal timing in hyperbolic response systems even worse and, thus, convert hyperbolic r ( A ) curves into depressed nonhyperbolic ones. Furthermore, under special timing conditions, nonhyperbolic r ( A ) curves can be generated, which are partly lifted, partly depressed relative to the reference hyperbola, and which resemble in shape well-known nonhyperbolic forms of enzyme and receptor kinetics (negatively cooperative, positively cooperative, and sigmoidal kinetics). In addition unusual (undulatory and sawtooth-like) r ( A ) curves can be generated solely by changing the temporal pattern of arrival and service completion instants. Virtually any shape of dose-response curves may be obtained by allowing for probability distributions whose characteristic shape varies with their mean; we call such distributions variomorphic and apply them to the arrival process of agonist molecules.",

However, recently compounds being ago-allosteric modulators have been described i.e., compounds acting both as agonists on their own and as enhancers for the endogenous agonists in both increasing agonist potency and providing additive efficacysuperagonism. The additive efficacy can also be observed with agonists, which are neutral or even negative modulators of the potency of the endogenous ligand. Based on the prevailing dimeric concept for 7TM receptors, it is proposed that the ago-allosteric modulators bind in the orthosteric binding site, butimportantlyin the other or allosteric protomer of the dimer. Hereby, they can act both as additive co-agonists, and through intermolecular cooperative effects between the protomers, they may influence the potency of the endogenous agonist. It is of interest that at least some endogenous agonists can only occupy one protomer of a dimeric 7TM receptor complex at a time and thereby they leave the orthosteric binding site in the allosteric protomer free, potentially for binding of exogenous, allosteric modulators. If the allosteric modulator is an agonist, it is an ago-allosteric modulator; if it is neutral, it is a classical enhancer. Molecular mapping in hetero-dimeric class-C receptors, where the endogenous agonist clearly binds only in one protomer, supports the notion that allosteric modulators can act through binding in the other protomer. It is suggested that for the in vivo, clinical setting a positive ago-allosteric modulator should be the preferred agonist drug.",

The steroid receptor family consists of proteins that have similar domain architecture including individual DNA and hormone-binding domains that have closely related three-dimensional structures. The discovery of O-linked GlcNAc on both androgen and estrogen receptors and the realization that the GlcNAc plays a role in the transcriptional activity of these receptors raise the possibility that this glycosylation is a common mechanism involved in transcriptional modulation in all members of the steroid receptor family. To test this hypothesis, we affinity purified the mouse glucocorticoid receptor from cell lines engineered to overexpress the receptor and used GlcNAc-specific lectin chromatography, lectin-blotting analysis, and galactosylation assay to assess the presence of GlcNAc modification. All three techniques were found to be highly sensitive when used with proteins known to harbor GlcNAc yet they failed to show the presence of GlcNAcylation on the mouse GR. We also determined the effect of mutation at seven major potential glycosylation sites of the receptor on its transcriptional activity. We conclude that either the mouse GR is not modified by GlcNAc or that the amount of the modification is so low that it cannot be detected.

We found that changes in cytoskeletal tubulin polymerization altered the strength of several IL-2-triggered signals. Moreover, Tax-induced tubulin hyperpolymerization augmented the surface expression of the IL-2R -chain and enhanced the association of the IL-2R -chain with cytoskeletal tubulin. The IL-2R -chain, in turn, was constitutively associated with tubulin and, more weakly, actin. To exclude the possibility that these associations are artifacts caused by PHA, we confirmed them in T cells from TCR-transgenic DO11.10 mice stimulated with their nominal antigen.

Targeting of effector proteins and regulatory proteins to ion channels is an important mechanism to ensure speed, specificity, and precise regulation of signaling events in response to local stimuli. In this article, we review recent experimental results showing that sodium and calcium channels form local signaling complexes, in which effector proteins, anchoring proteins, and regulatory proteins interact directly with ion channels. The intracellular domains of these channels serve as signaling platforms, mediating their participation in intracellular signaling processes. These protein-protein interactions are important for efficient synaptic transmission and for regulation of ion channels by neurotransmitters and intracellular second messengers. These localized signaling complexes are essential for normal function and regulation of electrical excitability, synaptic transmission, and excitation-contraction coupling.",

The analysis provides insights into diffusion-limited analyte-receptor reactions occurring on heterogeneous biosensor surfaces. Numerical values obtained for the binding and the dissociation rate coefficients are linked to the degree of heterogeneity or roughness [fractal dimension (D f )] present on the biosensor chip surface. The binding and dissociation rate coefficients are sensitive to the degree of heterogeneity on the surface. For example, for the binding of plasma insulin, as the fractal dimension value increases by a factor of 2.47 from D f1 0.6827 to D f2 1.6852, the binding rate coefficient increases by a factor of 4.92 from k 1 1.0232 to k 2 5.0388. An increase in the degree of heterogeneity on the probe surface leads to an increase in the binding rate coefficient. A dual-fractal analysis is required to fit the binding kinetics in most of the cases presented. A single fractal analysis is adequate to describe the dissociation kinetics. Affinity (ratio of the binding to the dissociation rate coefficient) values are also presented.

A 2 a R and D 2 R couple to stimulatory and inhibitory G proteins, respectively. Their opposing roles in regulating neuronal activities, such as locomotion and alcohol consumption, are mediated by their opposite actions on adenylate cyclase, which often serves as co-incidence detector of various activators. On the other hand, the neural actions of A 2 a R and D 2 R are also, at least partially, independent of each other, as indicated by studies using D 2 R and A 2 a R knock-out mice. Here we co-expressed human A 2 a R and human D 2 L R in CHO cells and examined their signaling characteristics. Human A 2 a R desensitized rapidly upon agonist stimulation. A 2 a R activity (80) was diminished after 2 hr of pretreatment with its agonist CGS21680. In contrast, human D 2 L R activity was sustained even after 2 hr and 18 hr pretreatment with its agonist quinpirole. Long-term (18 hr) stimulation of human D 2 L R also increased basal cAMP levels in CHO cells, whereas long-term (18 hr) activation of human A 2 a R did not affect basal cAMP levels. Furthermore, long-term (18 hr) activation of D 2 L R dramatically sensitized A 2 a R-induced stimulation of adenylate cyclase in a pertussis toxin-sensitive way. Forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation was significantly increased after short-term (2 hr) human D 2 L R stimulation and further elevated after long-term (18 hr) D 2 L R activation. However, neither short-term (2 hr) nor long-term (18 hr) stimulation of A 2 a R affected the inhibitory effects of D 2 L R on adenylate cyclase. Co-stimulation of A 2 a R and D 2 L R could not induce desensitization or sensitization of D 2 L R either.

We transduced recombinant IF-1 and IF-2, and ribozyme targeting both isoforms using an adenovirus vector in these cells. We detected the expression of IF-1 and IF-2 in both types of cells. IF-1 as well as IF-2 inhibited PDGF-induced DNA synthesis and migration in VSMCs. In contrast, both isoforms enhanced lysophosphatidic acid-stimulated cell migration without change in DNA synthesis in ECs. Whereas there is a report indicating that reactive oxygen species-dependent inactivation of LMW-PTP regulates actin cytoskeleton reorganization during cell spreading and migration, the isoforms conversely suppressed the PDGF-induced H 2 O 2 generation with subsequent decrease in the p38 activity in VSMCs. Catalytically inactive LMW-PTP exerted the opposite and similar effects to the wild type in ECs and in VSMCs, respectively, suggesting that substrates for the phosphatase differ between these cells.

Deoxycholate, which enhances agonist-induced phospholipase C (PLC) stimulation, markedly enhanced the agonistic effects of dopamine and SKF38393 to 530 and 637 above controls, respectively. The enhancing effects of deoxycholate were reversed if it was washed off the membranes before agonist addition. The thiol-reducing agent, dithiothreitol, completely abolished the effects of SKF38393 and SKF83959, whereas SKF85174 effects were augmented. Agonist responses were concentration-related, and highest efficacies were obtained in the hippocampus, thus paralleling both the brain regional distribution and agonist efficacies previously observed in phosphoinositide hydrolysis assays. These findings suggest that D 1 -like receptor conformations that mediate agonist stimulation of G s /adenylylcyclase may be structurally different from those that mediate G q /PLC activation. Although the exact mechanism of deoxycholate's effect awaits elucidation, the results are consistent with the emerging concept of functional selectivity whereby deoxycholate could create a membrane environment that facilitates the transformation of the receptor from a conformation that activates G s /adenylylcyclase to one that favors G q /PLC signaling.",

Junctional Adhesion Molecule, JAM) was first identified in human platelets as a 3235kDa protein duplex that serves as receptor for a functional monoclonal antibody that activates platelets. We have sequenced and cloned the F11R and determined that it is a member of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily of cell adhesion molecules. The signaling pathways involved in F11R-induced platelet activation were examined in this investigation. The binding of M.Ab.F11 to the platelet F11R resulted in granule secretion and aggregation. These processes were found to be dependent on the crosslinking of F11R with the Fc RII by M.Ab.F11. This crosslinking induced actin filament assembly with the conversion of discoidal platelets to activated shapes, leading to the formation of platelet aggregates. We demonstrate that platelet secretion and aggregation through the F11R involves actin filament assembly that is dependent on phosphoinositide-3 kinase activation, and inhibitable by wortmannin. Furthermore, such activation results in an increase in the level of free intracellular calcium, phosphorylation of the 32 and 35kDa forms of the F11R, F11R dimerization coincident with a decrease in monomeric F11R, and association of the F11R with the integrin GPIIIa and with CD9. On the other hand, F11R-mediated events resulting from the binding of platelets to an immobilized surface of M.Ab.F11 lead to platelet adhesion and spreading through the development of filopodia and lammelipodia. These adhesive processes are induced directly by interaction of M.Ab.F11 with the platelet F11R and are not dependent on the Fc RII. We also report here that the stimulation of the F11R in the presence of nonaggregating (subthreshold) concentrations of the physiological agonists thrombin and collagen, results in supersensitivity of platelets to natural agonists by a F11R-mediated process independent of the Fc RII. The delineation of the two separate F11R-mediated pathways is anticipated to reveal significant information on the role of this cell adhesion molecule in platelet adhesion, aggregation and secretion, and F11R-dependent potentiation of agonist-induced platelet aggregation. The participation of F11R in the formation and growth of platelet aggregates and plaques in cardiovascular disorders, resulting in enhanced platelet adhesiveness and hyperaggregability, may serve in the generation of novel therapies in the treatment of inflammatory thrombosis, heart attack and stroke, and other cardiovascular disorders.",

Under normal conditions, D 1 -like receptors (D 1 and D 5 ) inhibit sodium transport in the kidney and the intestine. However, in the Dahl salt-sensitive and spontaneously hypertensive rats, and humans with essential hypertension, the D 1 -like receptor-mediated inhibition of sodium transport is impaired because of an uncoupling of the D 1 -like receptor from its G proteineffector complex. The uncoupling is genetic, and receptor-, organ-, and nephron segment-specific. In human essential hypertension, the uncoupling of the D 1 receptor from its G proteineffector complex is caused by an agonist-independent serine phosphorylationdesensitization by constitutively active variants of the G protein-coupled receptor kinase type 4. The D 5 receptor is also important in blood pressure regulation. Disruption of the D 5 or the D 1 receptor gene in mice increases blood pressure. However, unlike the D 1 receptor, the hypertension in D 5 receptor null mice is caused by increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system, apparently due to activation of oxytocin, V 1 vasopressin, and non-N-methyl D-aspartate receptors in the central nervous system. The cause of the activation of these receptors remains to be determined.",

A quantitative description of the forces that govern molecular associations requires determination of changes of all thermodynamic parameters, including free energy of binding ( G ), enthalpy ( H ), and entropy ( S ) of binding and the heat capacity change (Cp). A close insight into the binding process is of significant and practical interest, since it provides the fundamental know-how for development of structure-based molecular design strategies. The only direct method to measure the heat change during complex formation at constant temperature is provided by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). With this method one binding partner is titrated into a solution containing the interaction partner, thereby generating or absorbing heat. This heat is the direct observable that can be quantified by the calorimeter. The use of ITC has been limited due to the lack of sensitivity, but recent developments in instrument design permit to measure heat effects generated by nanomol (typically 10100) amounts of reactants. ITC has emerged as the primary tool for characterizing interactions in terms of thermodynamic parameters. Because heat changes occur in almost all chemical and biochemical processes, ITC can be used for numerous applications, e.g., binding studies of antibodyantigen, proteinpeptide, proteinprotein, enzymeinhibitor or enzymesubstrate, carbohydrateprotein, DNAprotein (and many more) interactions as well as enzyme kinetics. Under appropriate conditions data analysis from a single experiment yields H , K B , the stoichiometry ( n ), G and S of binding. Moreover, ITC experiments performed at different temperatures yield the heat capacity change (Cp). The informational content of thermodynamic data is large, and it has been shown that it plays an important role in the elucidation of binding mechanisms and, through the link to structural data, also in rational drug design. In this review we will present a comprehensive overview to ITC by giving some historical background to calorimetry, outline some critical experimental and data analysis aspects, discuss the latest developments, and give three recent examples of studies published with respect to macromoleculeligand interactions that have utilized ITC technology.",

For B16 cells F1 and G4F sublines expressing B16 MCHR, the analog 125 I D Phe 13 , Tyr 19 MCH served as radioligand. The bioassay used for MCHR 1 was intracellular Ca 2 mobilization quantified with the FLIPR instrument, whereas for B16 MCHR the signal determined was MAP kinase activation. Our data show that some of the peptides displayed a similar relative increase or decrase of potency in both cell types tested. For example, linear MCH with Ser residues at positions 7 and 16 was almost inactive whereas a slight increase in sidechain hydrophilicity at residues 4 and 8, or truncation of MCH at the Nterminus by two residues hardly changed binding affinity or bioactivity. On the other hand, salmonic MCH which also lacks the first two residues of the mammalian sequence but in addition has different residues at positions 4, 5, 9, and 18 exhibited a 5 to 10fold lower binding activity than MCH in both cell systems. A striking difference in ligand recognition between MCHR 1 and B16 MCHR was however observed with modifications at position 13 of MCH: whereas L Phe 13 in Phe 13 , Tyr 19 MCH was well tolerated by both MCHR 1 and B16 MCHR, change of configuration to D Phe 13 in D Phe 13 , Tyr 19 MCH or D Phe 13 MCH led to a complete loss of biological activity and to a 5 to 10fold lower binding activity with MCHR 1 . By contrast, the D Phe 13 residue increased the affinity of D Phe 13 , Tyr 19 MCH to B16 MCHR about 10fold and elicited MAP kinase activation as observed with Phe 13 , Tyr 19 MCH or MCH. These data demonstrate that ligand recognition by B16 MCHR differs from that of MCHR 1 in several respects, indicating that the B16 MCHR represents an MCHR subtype different from MCHR 1 .",

The VEGFRfamily proteins consist of VEGFR1Flt1, VEGFR2KDRFlk1, and VEGFR3Flt4. Among these, VEGFR2 is thought to be principally responsible for angiogenesis. However, the precise role of VEGFRs13 in endothelial cell biology and angiogenesis remains unclear due in part to the lack of VEGFRspecific inhibitors. We used the newly described, highly selective anilinoquinazoline inhibitor of VEGFR2 tyrosine kinase, ZM323881 57benzyloxy quinazolin4ylamino4fluoro2methylphenol, to explore the role of VEGFR2 in endothelial cell function. Consistent with its reported effects on VEGFR2 IC50 &lt; 2 nM, ZM323881 inhibited activation of VEGFR2, but not of VEGFR1, epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR, plateletderived growth factor receptor PDGFR, or hepatocyte growth factor HGF receptor. We studied the effects of VEGF on human aortic endothelial cells HAECs, which express VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, but not VEGFR3, in the absence or presence of ZM323881. Inhibition of VEGFR2 blocked activation of extracellular regulatedkinase, p38, Akt, and endothelial nitric oxide synthetase eNOS by VEGF, but did not inhibit p38 activation by the VEGFR1specific ligand, placental growth factor PlGF. Inhibition of VEGFR2 also perturbed VEGFinduced membrane extension, cell migration, and tube formation by HAECs. Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor2 inhibition also reversed VEGFstimulated phosphorylation of CrkII and its Src homology 2 SH2binding protein p130 Cas , which are known to play a pivotal role in regulating endothelial cell migration. Inhibition of VEGFR2 thus blocked all VEGFinduced endothelial cellular responses tested, supporting that the catalytic activity of VEGFR2 is critical for VEGF signaling andor that VEGFR2 may function in a heterodimer with VEGFR1 in human vascular endothelial cells.",

The yeast pheromone response pathway has been adapted to allow liganddependent signaling of heterologous expressed Gprotein coupled receptors GPCRs via mammalian or chimeric yeastmammalian G proteins. Two different strategies are reported here which offer a positive screen for functional pairs. The OR and G protein are introduced into the modified yeast cells such that they hijack the pheromone response pathway usually resulting in cell cycle arrest. The first strategy utilizes ligandinduced expression of a FUS1HIS3 reporter gene to permit growth on a selective medium lacking histidine; the second to induce liganddependent expression of a FUS1Hph reporter gene, conferring resistance to hygromycin.

Of these only heptanal produced a positive growth response in the concentration range 5 10 8 to 5 10 6 M.

Rorfamily RTKs are characterized by the intracellular tyrosine kinase domains, highly related to those of the Trkfamily RTKs, and by the extracellular Frizzledlike cysteinerich domains CRDs and Kringle domains. Rors are evolutionally conserved among Caenorhabditis elegans , Aplysia , Drosophila melanogaster , Xenopus , mice, and humans.

In Aplysia and D. melanogaster , Rors are expressed exclusively in developing nervous systems. On the other hand, rather widespread expression of Rors was observed in C. elegans and mammals. Mutations in Ror of C. elegans cause inappropriate axon outgrowth as well as defects in cell migration and asymmetric cell division. It has also been reported that the nematode Ror possesses kinasedependent and kinaseindependent functions. Mouse Rors , Ror1 , and Ror2 , are expressed mainly in migrating neural crest cells and mesenchymal cells, and Ror2 deficient mice exhibit skeletal abnormalities and ventricular septal defects in the heart.

The receptor positions to mutate into cysteine were selected after a 3-D homology model. The observed receptor inactivations are mutant- and probe-selective, leading to an unambiguous chemical docking of the antagonist pharmacophore and supporting the model.

Secondly, specific monoclonal antibodies that enable researchers to identify, localize and quantify receptors can be produced very rapidly (weeks). Thirdly, it should be possible to apply phage display to the matching of orphan ligands and receptors. Finally, phage display can be used to identify proteins and peptides that modulate receptor activity. As well as being useful in the study of receptor function, biologically active proteins and peptides could also be used therapeutically, or as leads for drug design. Hence phage display is ready to play a central role in the study of receptors in the post-genome era.

A series of BODIPY TMR labeled peptides have been prepared that bind to a range of GPCRs including melanin concentrating hormone, bradykinin, and melanocortin receptors.

Using these cell lines and a homogeneous fluorescent derivative of H22Y-mEGF modified with fluorescein at the amino terminus (F-EGF), we have measured association and dissociation of F-EGF with its receptor. Association was measured by following the time-dependent changes in fluorescence anisotropy after rapidly mixing cells at various cell densities with F-EGF at 115nM. Dissociation was measured both by chase experiments in which unlabeled EGF was mixed with cells pre-equilibrated with F-EGF or by dilution of cells equilibrated with F-EGF. Comparison of these dissociation experiments demonstrated that little or no ligand-induced dissociation occurs in the chase dissociation experiments. For each cell line, data from a series of association experiments and dilution dissociation experiments were subjected to global analysis using a two independent receptor-class model. Our analysis is consistent with the presence of two distinct receptor populations, even in cells bearing only the EGF receptor.

These phenomena are expected to play a role in the physiological adaptation to endogenous ligands and also in the response to repetitive administration of drugs in the clinic. However, there is little information on homologous regulation of GPCRs in vivo. Here, we report on the regulation of melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) expression in melanoma cells implanted into mice. Two melanoma cell lines were investigated, D10 and B16F1, which in vitro had previously been shown to undergo homologous receptor up- and down-regulation, respectively. After implantation into mice and exposure to the natural MC1R agonist -melanocyte-stimulating hormone (-MSH), cell-surface MC1R expression was evaluated by competition binding experiments in tumor membrane preparations. In B16F1 cells, a single injection of 50 to 500g -MSH induced a rapid but moderate dose-dependent MC1R down-regulation which could be totally reverted within 1624h. By continuous administration of -MSH via osmotic minipumps, MC1R down-regulation was considerably amplified and reached the level observed in vitro, demonstrating that prolonged receptor interaction was necessary to induce a maximal effect in vivo. Similar results were obtained in vitro, which demonstrates that homologous MC1R regulation in B16F1 cells is essentially independent of the physiological environment. In D10 cells, however, up-regulation could not be reproduced in vivo, suggesting that MC1R up-regulation is more dependent on the physiological environment. These results demonstrate the importance of in vivo receptor regulation studies, in particular in view of the potential use of MC1R as a target for melanoma therapy.",

Work from our laboratory and others over the last several years has demonstrated that the non-pigmentary effects of A y are caused by ectopic expression of Agouti protein, a paracrine signaling molecule whose normal function is to inhibit signaling through the melanocortin 1 receptor (Mc1r), but which can mimic the effects of Agouti-related protein (Agrp), a homologous neuropeptide produced in the medial portion of the arcuate nucleus that acts as a potent antagonist of the Mc3r and Mc4r. Recently we have used the genetics of pigmentation as an in vivo screening system to analyze other mutations in the Agoutimelanocortin pathway, leading to the identification of Attractin (Atrn), a widely expressed type I transmembrane protein that serves as an accessory receptor for Agouti protein. Surprisingly, homologs of Atrn are found in fruitflies and nematodes, even though Agouti andor Agouti-related protein are found only in vertebrates. Insight into this apparent paradox now comes from studies of different Atrn alleles, in which we find hyperactivity, abnormal myelination, and widespread CNS vacuolation.

Methods: A group of six sheep (AF group) was subjected to overdrive electrical stimulation of the right atrium in order to induce AF. A group of six sham operated sheep served as control. All paced sheep developed multiple episodes of sustained AF with a mean total duration of 110min over a 2-hours period.

When significant changes in membrane expression were observed, transcriptional regulation was analysed by Northern blotting. Membrane fluidity was assessed on atrial microsomal fractions by anisotropy measurements using the fluorescent probe diphenylhexatriene. Results: Atrial fibrillation enhanced the expression of the Na,K-ATPase 1 -subunit at both membrane and mRNA levels.

Immediate early genes encode for transcription factors, structural proteins, cytokines, and other regulatory proteins. One of the latter category of IEG products is the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1), a dual specificity tyrosine phosphatase which inactivates the MAP kinase ERK in the nucleus. In GH4C1 neuroendocrine cells, MKP-1 is rapidly synthesised and translocated to the nucleus in response thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) or epidermal growth factor (EGF). Regulation of MKP-1 gene expression in this cell line is controlled at the transcriptional level via a strong block to elongation in the exon 1 of the gene. After stimulation with TRH the block to elongation is released and gene transcription is completed.

Saturation binding at 37C for 2h revealed the presence of high-affinity binding sites for CS with a K d of 2.3 10 9 molL and a B max of 5.0 10 8 . Extensive dialysis of Chondrosulf led to a decrease of the binding affinity by 52.5 19.5 and of the number of CS binding sitescell by 62.0 14.0, demonstrating that the additive present in the Condrosulf preparation enhances CS binding. The nature of the binding site is not yet known but evidence exists in the literature that the scavenger receptor CD36, thoroughly investigated on macrophages, is also found on chondrocytes and might be involved in CS binding. Therefore, we undertook a comparative binding study with human monocytes and labelled LDL and oxidized LDL, the latter being a postulated atherogenic agent in atherosclerosis.

Melanocyte stimulating hormone receptor is activated by -melanocyte-stimulating hormone (-MSH). Stimulated MSH-R activates adenylyl cyclase (AC), thereby increasing the amount of cyclic AMP in the cell, which activates the enzyme tyrosinase resulting in eumelanin synthesis. In this study the complete coding sequences of five alleles of the MSH-R gene found in Holstein, Red Holstein, Simmental, and Brown Swiss cattle were cloned into a mammalian expression vector and transfected into human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. The expressed receptors were analyzed for their ability to increase intracellular cAMP in response to stimulation by -MSH. The recessive red allele ( e ) found in Red Holstein and Simmental and the dominant black allele ( E D ) found in Holstein were unresponsive to a wide range of -MSH concentrations. Two alleles from Brown Swiss ( E d1 , E d2 ) and one allele found in the Simmental breed ( e f ) responded to stimulation by -MSH in a dose-dependent manner. When compared to E d1 and E d2 , the cells transfected with the e f MSH-R allele, however, reached the corresponding intracellular cAMP concentrations at a 10-fold higher concentration of -MSH. In conjunction with the mode of inheritance of coat colour, the results indicate that the e MSH-R allele is a non-functional receptor, E D is constitutively activated receptor, and E d1 and E d2 are hormonally activated receptors. The delay in e f MSH-R response may explain the similarity between the e and e f phenotypes.",

In the past, we have used several approaches around photoaffinity labeling in order to establish contact points between peptide ligands and their cognate receptors. Such contact points are helpful to build reality based molecular models of GPCRs and to elucidate their activation mechanisms. Most studies of peptidergic GPCRs have been done with photolabeling peptides containing the benzophenone moiety as a reputedly non-selective probe. However our recent results are now showing that p -benzoylphenylalanine (Bpa) has some selectivity for Met residues in the receptor protein, reducing the accuracy of this method. Turning a problem into an asset, modified analogues of Bpa, e.g. p , p -nitrobenzoylphenylalanine (NO 2 Bpa), display increased selectivity for such Met residues. It means a photoprobe containing such modified benzophenone-moieties does not label a receptor protein unless a Met residue is in the immediate vicinity. This unique property allows us to propose and show the feasibility and utility of a new method for scanning the contact areas of peptidergic GPCRs, the Methionine Proximity Assay (MPA). Putative contact residues of the receptor are exchanged to Met residues by site-directed mutagenesis and are subjected to photoaffinity labeling with such modified benzophenone-containing peptides. Successful incorporation indicates physical proximity of those residues. This principle is established and explored with benzophenone-containing analogues of angiotensin II and the two known human angiotensin II receptors AT 1 and AT 2 , determining contact points in both receptors. This approach has several important advantages over other scanning approaches, e.g., the SCAM procedure, since the MPA-method can be used in the hydrophobic core of receptors.",

The characterization of unknown gene products is facilitated by the knowledge of its binding partners. Thus, a novel protein may be classified by identifying previously characterized proteins that interact with it. If such an approach is carried out on a large scale, it may allow the rapid characterization of the thousands of predicted open reading frames identified by recent sequencing projects. Currently, the yeast two-hybrid system is the most widely used genetic assay for the detection of proteinprotein interactions. The yeast two-hybrid system has become popular because it requires little individual optimization and because, as compared to conventional biochemical methods, the identification and characterization of proteinprotein interactions can be completed in a relatively short time span. In this review, we briefly discuss the yeast two-hybrid system and its application to large scale screening studies that aim at deciphering all proteinprotein interactions taking place in a given cell type or organism. We then focus on a class of proteins that is unsuitable for conventional yeast two-hybrid systems, namely integral membrane proteins and membrane-associated proteins, and describe several novel genetic systems that combine the advantages of the yeast two-hybrid system with the potential to identify interaction partners of membrane-associated proteins in their natural setting.",

Of particular interest are universal screening systems such that activation of any GPCR can be detected with a common assay end point. The promiscuous G protein G 16 and chimeric G proteins are broadly used tools for setting up almost universal assay systems. Many efforts focused on making G proteins more promiscuous, however no attempts have been made to make promiscuos G proteins more sensitive by interfering with their cellular protein distribution. As a model system, we used a promiscuous G protein q subunit, that lacks the highly conserved six amino acid N-terminal extension and bears four residues of i sequence at its C-terminus replacing the corresponding q sequence (referred to as 6qi4). When expressed in COS7 cells, 6qi4 undergoes palmitoylation at its N-terminus. Cell fractionation and immunoblotting analysis indicated localization in the particulate and cytosolic fraction. Interestingly, introduction of a consensus site for N-terminal myristoylation (the resulting mutant referred to as 6qi4myr) created a protein that was dually acylated and exclusively located in the particulate fraction. As a measure of G protein activation 6qi4 and 6qi4myr were coexpressed (in CHO cells) with a series of different Gio coupled receptors and ligand induced increases in intracellular Ca 2 release were determined with the FLIPR technology (Fluorescence plate imaging reader from Molecular Devices Corp.). All of the receptors interacted more efficiently with 6qi4myr as compared with 6qi4. It could be shown that increased functional responses of agonist activated GPCRs are due to the higher content of 6qi4myr in the plasma membrane. Our results indicate that manipulation of subcellular localization of G protein subunitsmoving them from the cytosol to the plasma membrane-potentiates signaling of agonist activated GPCRs. It is concluded that addition of myristoylation sites into otherwise exclusively palmitoylated G proteins is a new and sensitive approach and may be applicable when functional assays are expected to yield weak signals as is the case when screening extracts of tissues for biologically active GPCR ligands.",

In the present study it was tested whether IL-4 counters Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF)-1 through competition at the IRS signal transduction pathway and, thus, induces a molecular insulin resistance or whether IL-4 invokes an alternative signal transduction. The activated receptors of IL-4 and IGF-1 both docked to IRS-1 and IRS-2 and invoked IRS complex formation with phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase, as assessed by immunoprecipitation and detection of the precipitated compounds by immunoblot analysis. Both, IL-4 and IGF-1, signaling pathways induced phosphorylation of Akt kinase in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner, as assessed by addition of the PI 3-kinase inhibitor Ly294002. Interleukin-4 stimulation induced mono-phosphorylation at serine residue S473 of Akt kinase but failed to activate the kinase. Insulin-like growth factor-1 stimulation invoked dual-phosphorylation at S473 and T308 of Akt kinase and subsequent activation of the kinase. When LS513 cells were treated with IL-4 to induce mono-phosphorylation of Akt, dual-phosphorylation and activation of Akt kinase in response to IGF-1 were still intact. Interleukin-4 yet reduced cell growth by at least 50 both, in the absence and presence of growth factor IGF-1. In the LS513 cells, IL-4 stimulated phosphorylation of Jak2, an adapter molecule at the IL-4 receptor, and phosphorylation of transcription factor Stat6 both, in the absence and presence of IGF-1. We found a similar IL-4 signal transduction and growth suppression in multiple human cell cultures, including primary cells. Our findings indicate that the molecular mechanism underlying growth suppression by IL-4 may depend on gene-expression but not on insulingrowth factor resistance at IRS.",

According to the current model ligand-binding triggers an exchange between corepressor- and coactivator-complexes that inhibit or potentiate transcription by deacetylating and acetylating nucleosomal histones, respectively. Additional cofactors may modify the transcriptional regulatory process by linking liganded retinoid receptors to structural components of chromatin or protein degradation. The desire to specifically influence defined events in RA-signalling, while others are left unaffected, motivated the synthesis of retinoid X receptors (RXR)- and retinoid acid receptors (RAR) isoform-selective retinoids. The present study investigates the potential of RAR isotype-specific synthetic agonists and antagonists to separate the processes of coactivator recruitment and corepressor release. The synthetic retinoids studied fall into four categories, two of which work according the above model, since they induce surfaces within the RAR ligand binding domain (LBD) suitable for either corepressor or coactivator interaction; these retinoids act as pure antagonists and pure agonists, respectively. In contrast, another type of retinoid induces a structure that allows for both, the interaction with corepressors and coactivators (partial RAR agonist), and exerts a cell context-specific (ant)agonistic activity. Finally, another type of retinoid, which cannot activate transcription itself but renders heterodimeric RAR permissive for signaling by RXR agonists inhibits both, corepressor and coactivator interaction (partial antagonist). Moreover, this retinoid discriminates between the nuclear corepressors SMRT and NCoR, since it efficiently dissociates SMRT but not NCoR from the RAR LBD.",

In the presence of the cell permeable substrate DeepBlueC, RLuc emits blue light at 395nm. If the GFP 2 is brought into close proximity to RLuc via a specific biomolecular interaction, the GFP 2 will absorb the blue light energy and reemit green light at 510nm. BRET 2 signals are therefore easily determined by measuring the ratio of green over blue light (510395nm) using appropriate dual channel luminometry instruments (e.g., Fusion Universal Microplate Analyzer, Packard BioScience). Since no light source is required for BRET 2 assays, the technology does not suffer from high fluorescent background or photobleaching, the common problems associated with standard FRET-based assays. Using BRET 2 , we developed a generic G ProteinCoupled Receptor (GPCR) assay based on the observation that activation of the majority of GPCRs by agonists leads to the interaction of -arrestin (a protein that is involved in receptor desensitization and sequestration) with the receptor. We established a cell line stably expressing the GFP 2 : -arrestin 2 fusion protein, and showed that it can be used to monitor the activation of various transiently expressed GPCRs, in BRET 2 arrestin assays.

In Ca 2 -free medium, after treatment with 1 M thapsigargin (an endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 pump inhibitor), 5 M histamine failed to increase [Ca 2 ] i . Histamine (5 M)-induced intracellular Ca 2 release was abolished by inhibiting phospholipase C with 2 M 1-(6-((17b-3-methoxyestra-1,3,5 [10] -trien-17-yl)amino)hexyl)-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione; U73122), and by 5 M pyrilamine but was unaltered by 50 M cimetidine.

Novel non-cytopathogenic and temperature-sensitive SFV vectors have recently been developed by introduction of point mutations in the viral nonstructural genes nsP2 and nsP4. These vectors do not show the typical shut down of host cell protein synthesis after SFV infections and therefore allow for a substantially prolonged survival of host cells.

Radioreceptor assays using [ 125 I]MCH, [ 125 I]-MSH and [ 125 I]NEI as radioligands and bioassays were performed with MC1-R-positive and MC1-R-negative mouse B16 melanoma cells and with COS cells expressing the different MC receptors.

Here, we describe a simplified method that combined using multiwell tissue culture plates in transfection and sample preparation and a modified single step method for quantitatively assaying CAT activity. By using multiwell plates, the tedious sample preparation procedure was dramatically simplified. The CAT assay is performed by mixing cell lysate, chloramphenicol, 3 H-acetyl co-enzyme A and non-aqueous scintillation fluid in scintillation vials, followed by automatically continuously counting samples two or three cycles at fixed time intervals. The catalytic reaction and determination of CAT activity are carried out in the vials simultaneously.

Once inside the microorganism, the DNA is transcribed and translated into amino acids, according to the genetic code. The DNA fragments coding for the peptides are inserted into specific DNA molecules called vectors. In phage display the vector is constituted by the viral genome, while in bacterial display an extrachromosomal circular DNA, called plasmid, is used. Vectors are usually genetically modified to allow the insertion of DNA fragments at specific sites and, sometimes, genes or regulatory regions are deleted or inserted. Each DNA fragment of a library contains a different sequence. In order to obtain all possible sequences it is necessary to synthesize degenerated oligonucleotides chemically. Since in fully degenerated oligonucleotides there is the possibility of introducing stop codons that will interrupt protein synthesis, and consequently the display, alternative methods are used. These methods utilize, during the synthesis, different mixtures of nucleotides, especially in the third position of each triplet, lowering the probability of introducing a stop codon. The pool of degenerated oligonucleotides is then made double stranded by enzymatic reactions and, after cleavage of the ends with appropriate restriction enzymes, the DNA fragments are inserted into a linearized vector and used to transform the appropriate microorganism.",

The interest in the idea of pharmacophores has grown enormously in recent years owing to the availability of various automated computerized software for identifying pharmacophores as well as their geometry. The pharmacophoric information as well as their three-dimensional structure can often be used to identify novel pharmacologically active lead compounds by searching various databases of known chemicals, like the Available Chemical Directory (ACD). Compounds having similar pharmacophoric groups often have similar biological activity. Understandably, the existence of similar or the same pharmacophoric groups does not guarantee that biological activity will be similar.

It is well known that stimulation of endogenous protein kinase C by phorbol esters reduces inhibition of the agonist-induced [Ca super(2+)] sub(i) rise in many cell types, including endothelial cells. Inhibition of calcium response is accompanied by a reduction in phosphoinositide metabolism. Thus it might be concluded that the agonist-induced [Ca super(2+)] sub(i) rise is inhibited by suppression of the first step in signal transduction at the level of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC).

The key feature of this assay system is the isolation of stable, clonal Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines that carry three separate expression plasmids: (1) a chimeric Gq/i5 protein (which re-directs a negative Gi-type signal to a positive Gq-type response), (2) a given Gi-GPCR, and (3) a beta-lactamase (beta1a) reporter gene responsive to Gi-GPCR signaling.

The standard screening assays used in regular molecular pharmacology, have been poorly assessed when transposed to combinatorial chemistry-related experiments, particularly those involving large numbers of chemicals in a single assay. One key issue is the effect of the inactive analogs on the identification of the active ligand in mixtures. We chose melatonin receptors to measure the apparent affinity of a single ligand when tested alone or in mixtures of non-peptide low molecular weight compounds. Using ligands with IC50 from the micro- to the picomolar range, mixed with increasingly complex mixtures of 5 to 20 or 25 inactive compounds, we analyzed the displacements from the mt1 and MT2 melatonin receptor subtypes of the radioligand 2-iodomelatonin (KD= 25 pmol/l and 200 pmol/l, respectively) . The behavior of equimolar mixtures in displacement curves led to the conclusion that the observed binding affinity reflects the dilution effect of mixing the active component with inactive compounds but does not reveal noticeable interactions which would interfere with the binding process. From the practical point of view, the concentrations of the active species in the binding assay should be large enough to displace significantly the radioligand, a requirement which may be limited by the solubility of the ligand mixtures. In contrast, previous observations with peptide libraries report that the dilution effect is often compensated by additive or synergic action of structurally related analogs, thus making possible the deconvolution of very large (typically up to 10(7) compounds) peptide libraries.",

Given the PKA dependence of beta2AR-Gi coupling, we explored whether this may be a mechanism of agonist-promoted desensitization. HEK293 cells were transfected to express beta2AR or beta2AR and Gialpha2, and then treated with vehicle or the agonist isoproterenol to evoke agonist-promoted beta2AR desensitization. Membrane AC activities showed that Gialpha2 overexpression decreased basal levels, but the fold-stimulation of the AC over basal by agonist was not altered. However, with treatment of the cells with isoproterenol prior to membrane preparation, a marked decrease in agonist-stimulated AC was observed with the cells overexpressing Gialpha2. In the absence of such overexpression, beta2AR desensitization was 23+/-7%, while with 5-fold Gialpha2 overexpression desensitization was 58+/-5% (p<0.01, n=4). The effect of Gi on desensitization was receptor-specific, in that forskolin responses were not altered by G(i)alpha2 overexpression.

Detergent type, detergent-protein ratio, absence of Mg2+ and temperature were deemed to be important factors. However, the increases observed in binding site specific activity were minimal compared with those achieved for yields. Maximum percentage yields of binding activity (25%) were achieved with a low concentration of the zwitterionic detergent, CHAPS, in the presence of a low protein concentration. This yield was further enhanced on combining mixtures of detergents. The highest recovery (37%) was achieved with a 50:50 (v:v; 1.5 x critical micelle concentration) mixture of the ionic detergent, sodium cholate, and the non-ionic detergent, MEGA-10.

Secondly, AutoSynch avoids signalAll by using a property called relay invariance that guarantees that whenever possible there is always at least one thread whose condition is true which has been signaled. Finally, AutoSynch uses a technique called predicate tagging to efficiently determine a thread that should be signaled. To evaluate the efficiency of AutoSynch, we have implemented many different well-known synchronization problems such as the producers/consumers problem, the readers/writers problems, and the dining philosophers problem. The results show that AutoSynch is almost as efficient as the explicit-signal monitor and even more efficient for some cases.",

        "des": "An implicit (automatic) signal monitor uses a waituntil predicate statement to construct synchronization, as opposed to an explicit-signal monitor using condition variables and signal/wait statements for synchronization. Of the two synchronization approaches, the implicit-signal monitor is often easier to use and prove correct, but has an inherently high execution cost. Hence, its primary use is for prototyping concurrent systems using monitors, where speed and accuracy of software development override execution performance. After a concurrent system is working, any implicit-signal monitor that is a performance bottleneck can be converted to an explicit-signal monitor. Unfortunately, many monitor-based concurrency systems provide only explicit-signal monitors, precluding the design benefits of implicit-signal monitors.This article presents a historical look at the development of the implicit-signal monitor in relation to its counterpart the explicit-signal monitor. An analysis of the different kinds of implicit-signal monitors shows the effects certain design decisions have on the problems that can be solved and the performance of the solutions. Finally, an extensive discussion is presented on simulating an implicit-signal monitor via different explicit-signal monitors. These simulations are reasonably complex, depending on the kind of explicit-signal monitor available for the simulation and the desired semantics required for the implicit-signal monitor. Interestingly, the complexity of the simulations also illustrates certain deficiencies with explicit-signal monitors, which are discussed in detail. Performance comparisons are made among the different simulations with monitors from the concurrent systems PThreads, Java, and \u03bcC&plus;&plus;.",

This map is usually built manually by a person holding the mapping device, which results in orientation-dependent fingerprints due to signal attenuation by the human body. To offset this distortion, fingerprints are typically collected for multiple orientations, but this requires a high effort for large localization areas. In this paper, we propose an approach to reduce the mapping effort by modeling the WLAN signal attenuation caused by the human body. By applying the model to the captured signal to compensate for the attenuation, it is possible to generate an orientation-independent fingerprint. We demonstrate that our model is location and person independent and its output is comparable with manually created radio maps. By using the model, the WLAN scanning effort can be reduced by 75% to 87.5% (depending on the number of orientations).",

Here, we present Mudra, a fine-grained finger gesture recognition system which leverages WiFi signals to enable a near-human-to-machine interaction with finger motion. Mudra uses a two-antenna receiver to detect and recognize finger gesture. It uses the signals received from one antenna to cancel the signal from the other. This \"cancellation\" is extremely sensitive to and enables us detect small variation in channel due to finger movements. Since Mudra decodes gestures with existing WiFi transmissions, Mudra enables gesture recognition without sacrificing WiFi transmission opportunities. Besides, Mudra is user-friendly with no need of user training. To demonstrate Mudra, we implement prototype on the NI-based SDR platform and use COTS WiFi adapter.

Traditional techniques for crosstalk reduction focus on reducing the coupling capacitance between interconnect nets to maximize the crosstalk slack among the nets. Although effective in reducing the worst-case crosstalk, such a strategy is incapable of minimizing the average run-time crosstalk which is equivalently critical for the timing and functional correctness of nanoscale VLSI. The minimization of both worst-case and average crosstalk necessitates the consideration of signal correlation information determined by circuit logic during the layout optimization stage. In this paper, a post-global routing technique is proposed to reduce the run-time crosstalk risk without violating the worst-case crosstalk bound specified by traditional techniques. A measure is proposed to accurately capture the signal correlation and model the run-time behavior of net pairs. Adjustment in the routing track assignment is performed under the guidance of run-time information to reduce the chance of neighboring nets having crosstalk-generating signal transitions. Meanwhile, the coupling length of each net is still controlled to within a specific bound for the maximization of the minimal crosstalk slack. Experimental results show that, compared to the conventional approaches, the proposed technique achieves significant reduction in average crosstalk without exacerbating the minimal crosstalk slack of the circuit.",

In this paper, we introduce BST, a novel physical layer for backscatter communication that enables concurrent transmission by leveraging intra-bit multiplexing of OOK signals from multiple tags.

We use Microsoft Kinect 3D depth sensing camera with the online Second Life virtual world to record rehabilitation exercises performed by a physiotherapist or a disabled child. The exercise session can be played synchronously in Second Life. The physical activities of the users are synchronized with their virtual counterparts in the Second Life. The exercises can be recorded as well and made available for downloading to facilitate offline playback. A disabled child can follow the exercise at home in the absence of the therapist, since the system can provide visual guidance for performing the exercise in the right manner. Using the proposed system, parents at home can also assist the disabled child in performing therapy sessions in the absence of a therapist. Following the suggestions of therapists, the developed prototype can track several gestures of children who have mobility problems. Using a single Kinect device, we can capture high resolution joint movement of the body, without the need for any complicated hardware set up. The initial joint-based angular measurements show promising potential of our prototype to be deployed in real physiotherapy sessions.",

Furthermore, while more secure than passwords, second-factor schemes still fail to provide sufficient protection against (single-use) phishing attacks. We present PhoneAuth, a system intended to provide security assurances comparable to or greater than that of conventional two-factor authentication systems while offering the same authentication experience as traditional passwords alone.

First, a user's personal device (eg a phone) can communicate directly with the user's computer (and hence the remote web server) without any interaction with the user. Second, it is possible to provide a layered approach to security, whereby a web server can enact different policies depending on whether or not the user's personal device is present.

For instance, even though the invariants describing the behavior of two functions f1 and f2 may be unknown, we may know that any valid input for f1 is also valid for f2, i.e., the precondition of f1 implies that of f2. We explore techniques for expressing and employing such consistency constraints to improve the quality of produced invariants. We further introduce techniques for dynamically discovering potential second-order constraints that the programmer can subsequently approve or reject.   Our implementation builds on the Daikon tool, with a vocabulary of constraints that the programmer can use to enhance and constrain Daikon\u2019s inference. We show that dynamic inference of second-order constraints together with minimal human effort can significantly influence the produced (first-order) invariants even in systems of substantial size, such as the Apache Commons Collections and the AspectJ compiler.

Because of SL's global presence and popularity, it is perceived to be a potentially powerful learning environment for serving our geographically dispersed military. In particular, it is professed to be a highly effective learning environment that targets interactivity and engagement. However these worlds have not been empirically tested. This paper presents results investigating the factors that contribute to engagement and performance in SL. The study was conducted on an Air Force SL island, developed for collaboration, teaming, and innovative research. 100 participants completed the activity. A self-directed, inquiry-based activity, tagged VWQuest, was taken from a grounded instructional framework and adapted for virtual worlds. Data were collected including performance measures and engagement levels using Csikszentmihalyi's Flow Theory. It was found previously that higher levels of engagement correlated with increased learning. The engagement factors, Sense of Control and Loss of Time were found to be the most significant contributors. This suggests that learners who perceive a sense of control over their learning, or if the learning opportunity is not bounded by time, may be engaged more. Having an engaging experience while learning in Second Life may in fact, contribute to an individuals' ability to learn. Results also indicated that technology was successfully integrated throughout.

We present an augmented version of instant messaging, WaitChatter, that supports the notion of wait-learning by displaying contextually relevant foreign language vocabulary and micro-quizzes just-in-time while the user awaits a response from her conversant. Through a two week field study of WaitChatter with 20 people, we found that users were able to learn 57 new words on average during casual instant messaging. Furthermore, we found that users were most receptive to learning opportunities immediately after sending a chat message, and that this timing may be critical given user tendency to multi-task during waiting periods.",

We introduce a novel algorithm, loqr, which is designed to relax queries that are in the disjunctive normal form and contain a mixture of discrete and continuous attributes. loqr discovers the implicit relationships that exist among the various domain attributes and then uses this knowledge to relax the constraints from the failing query.In a first step, loqr uses a small, randomly-chosen subset of the target database to learn a set of decision rules that predict whether an attribute's value satisfies the constraints in the failing query; this  query-driven operation is performed online for each failing query. In the second step, loqr uses nearest-neighbor techniques to find the learned rule that is the most similar to the failing query; then it uses the attributes' values from this rule to relax the failing query's constraints. Our experiments on six application domains show that loqr is both robust and fast: it successfully relaxes more than 95% of the failing queries, and it takes under a second for processing queries that consist of up to 20 attributes (larger queries of up to 93 attributes are processed in several seconds).",

Publisher applications generate events that are forwarded to subscriber applications by a network of brokers. Subscribers register by specifying filters that brokers match against events as part of the routing process. Brokers might be deployed on untrusted servers where malicious entities can get access to events and filters. Supporting confidentiality of events and filters in this setting is still an open challenge. First of all, it is desirable that publishers and subscribers do not share secret keys, such a requirement being against the loose-coupling of the model. Second, brokers need to route events by matching encrypted events against encrypted filters. This should be possible even with very complex filters. Existing solutions do not fully address these issues. This work describes the implementation of a novel schema that supports (i) confidentiality for events and filters; (ii) filters that express very complex constraints on events even if brokers are not able to access any information on both events and filters; (iii) and finally, does not require publishers and subscribers to share keys.

In this paper we analyze the neuronal communication as potential paradigm to be applied for communication between nano-scale devices and define the stochastic spiking model, that is confined to randomness associated with neuron's firing, in order to acquire and quantify the neuron's response given specified stimulus. We also present synaptic transmission process and modifications related to memory formation and storage using existing simplified theoretical models on calcium dependent behavior and learning. Using modeling, theory, and findings presented in this paper, one can design the stimulus with adequate power spectral density in order to evoke desired synaptic modifications in terms of its strengthening and weakening. Similar approach provides a basement for future technologies and controlling method for nano-scale communication between peers.",

        "des": "The incidence of renal calculus in the urinary tract has been known as a problem since long. Urinary stone disease is an extremely painful condition and it can be formed with calculus can formed at number of locations, types and shapes in the urinary system, principal sites being the lower calyx pelvis of the kidney, urethra and the bladder. Detection of renal calculus presence in the early stages of growth is beneficial in the appropriate management of the condition that can take place, with options that include removal of calculus and diet modification. The objective of this work is to provide set of most significant content descriptive factors to identify and classify renal calculi. Most of the times physician decides the method to remove the stone by observing grey scale renal stone image and judging its' type, location and shape, but there is absence of the system in supporting their decision about the calculus. At least nine different types of renal calculi have been identified based on their chemical composition namely Calcium Oxalate Monohydrate (with mineral composition Whewellite), Calcium Oxalate Dihydrate (Weddelite), Magnesium Ammonium Phosphate Hexahydrate (struvite), Hydroxyapatite, Calcium Hydr. Phosphate Dihydrate (Brushite), Tricalcium Phosphate (Whitlockite), Uric acid, Cystine and Xanthine. HONDA make ultrasound scanner (model HS 2000) is used to acquire renal stone image of phantom design using balloon filled with water and renal stones of different chemical compositions, suspended in it. These acquired images are then analyzed using MATLAB for identifying various features including gray scale intensity variation in range, average, mean, median, standard deviation, area, volume and profile of renal calculi. There is a significant difference observed in features among different types of calculi.",

        "des": "Overactive bladder (OAB) is a social hygienic problem, which is characterized by sudden involuntary contraction of the detrusor smooth muscle (DSM) cells. From several experimental studies, it is found that DSM cells from various species including human generate spontaneous action potentials (sAPs) [1, 2], an important concept to initiate spontaneous phasic contraction activity. A primary physiological understanding for unstable urinary bladder contraction is hyperexcitability due to changes in intrinsic ionic mechanisms of DSM cells. A transient rise in cytoplasmic calcium [Ca2+]i is an important reason behind this cellular contraction event. The Ca2+ influx via L-type calcium (Ca2+) channel is essential for the rising phase of the DSM action potential (AP), whereas various potassium (K+) channels mediate the repolarization and after hyperpolarization (AHP) period of the AP, respectively [2,8]. In various smooth muscle cells, inward rectifying channel (Ih) has been playing an important role in regulating resting membrane potential (RMP) and basal tone. By using the whole cell voltage clamp method, Ih channel currents have been recorded in smooth muscle cells from various animals. The modulating role of Ih channel is also well documented in other excitatory cells like neuronal and cardiac tissues. Therefore, a detailed biophysical study of Ih channel is essential to investigate DSM cell's excitability towards bladder overactivity.",

In fact, temporal and spatial control of aroma constituent is the elemental technology. The long-term preservation of the aromatic materials and the miniaturization of olfactory display are also desirable. Most traditional researches on olfactory displays focused on temporal control of aroma, but the importance of spatial control of aroma was not well realized. In addition, some of previous olfactory displays used liquid-type aromatic materials, which were nondurable. In this research, we generated directional air flow with aromas by using micro air flow source. With this approach, spatial control of aroma and miniaturization of olfactory display were achieved. Furthermore, we were able to extend the duration of aromatic materials, as the aroma source enclosed in a calcium silicate was encapsulated inside the nearly-sealed device.",
